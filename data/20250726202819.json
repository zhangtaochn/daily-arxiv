    "summary": "Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic\nrepresentations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of\ntask understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic\nreasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation\nModels (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.\nNevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic\ngranularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,\n(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address\nthese challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for\nsemantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and\nMLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs\nhierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,\nthe framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which\ninteract with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from\nnatural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level\nextraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are\nencoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive\nbehavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world\nexperiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical\nlab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse\nmanipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability\nand generalization.

In this work, we identify that removing any layer induces a significant\nmagnitude gap in hidden states, resulting in substantial performance\ndegradation. To address this issue, we propose Prune&Comp, a novel\nplug-and-play layer pruning scheme that leverages magnitude compensation to\nmitigate such gaps in a training-free manner. Specifically, we first estimate\nthe magnitude gap caused by layer removal and then eliminate this gap by\nrescaling the remaining weights offline, with zero runtime overhead incurred.\nWe further demonstrate the advantages of Prune&Comp through an iterative\npruning strategy. When integrated with an iterative prune-and-compensate loop,\nPrune&Comp consistently enhances existing layer pruning metrics. For instance,\nwhen 5 layers of LLaMA-3-8B are pruned using the prevalent block influence\nmetric, Prune&Comp nearly halves the perplexity and retains 93.19\\% of the\noriginal model's question-answering performance, outperforming the baseline by\n4.01%.",

In our study, we investigate the impact\nof instruction-tuning on LLM's susceptibility to misinformation.

A comparison with base models\nshows that instruction-tuning increases reliance on user-provided information,\nshifting susceptibility from the assistant role to the user role. Furthermore,\nwe explore additional factors influencing misinformation susceptibility, such\nas the role of the user in prompt structure, misinformation length, and the\npresence of warnings in the system prompt.

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM)-based automatic speech recognition (ASR) has\nrecently attracted a lot of attention due to its high recognition accuracy and\nenhanced multi-dialect support. However, the high decoding latency of LLMs\nchallenges the real-time ASR requirements. Although speculative decoding has\nbeen explored for better decoding efficiency, they usually ignore the key\ncharacteristics of the ASR task and achieve limited speedup. To further reduce\nthe real-time ASR latency, in this paper, we propose a novel speculative\ndecoding framework specialized for ASR, dubbed SpecASR. SpecASR is developed\nbased on our core observation that ASR decoding is audio-conditioned, which\nresults in high output alignment between small and large ASR models, even given\noutput mismatches in intermediate decoding steps. Therefore, SpecASR features\nan adaptive draft sequence generation process that dynamically modifies the\ndraft sequence length to maximize the token acceptance length. SpecASR further\nproposes a draft sequence recycling strategy that reuses the previously\ngenerated draft sequence to reduce the draft ASR model latency. Moreover, a\ntwo-pass sparse token tree generation algorithm is also proposed to balance the\nlatency of draft and target ASR models. With extensive experimental results, we\ndemonstrate SpecASR achieves 3.04x-3.79x and 1.25x-1.84x speedup over the\nbaseline autoregressive decoding and speculative decoding, respectively,\nwithout any loss in recognition accuracy.",

    "summary": "While large language models (LLMs) leverage both knowledge and reasoning\nduring inference, the capacity to distinguish between them plays a pivotal role\nin model analysis, interpretability, and development. Inspired by dual-system\ncognitive theory, we propose a cognition attribution framework to decouple the\ncontribution of knowledge and reasoning. In particular, the cognition of LLMs\nis decomposed into two distinct yet complementary phases: knowledge retrieval\n(Phase 1) and reasoning adjustment (Phase 2). To separate these phases, LLMs\nare prompted to generate answers under two different cognitive modes, fast\nthinking and slow thinking, respectively. The performance under different\ncognitive modes is analyzed to quantify the contribution of knowledge and\nreasoning. This architecture is employed to 15 LLMs across 3 datasets. Results\nreveal: (1) reasoning adjustment is domain-specific, benefiting\nreasoning-intensive domains (e.g., mathematics, physics, and chemistry) and\npotentially imparing knowledge-intensive domains. (2) Parameter scaling\nimproves both knowledge and reasoning, with knowledge improvements being more\npronounced. Additionally, parameter scaling make LLMs reasoning significantly\nmore prudent, while moderately more intelligent. (3) Knowledge primarily\nresides in lower network layers, while reasoning operates in higher layers.

A\nkey innovation of ICWLM is its utilization of in-context learning (ICL),\nenabling the model to adapt to varying system configurations and channel\nconditions with minimal demonstration pairs, eliminating the need for extensive\nretraining. Furthermore, we employ the Dynamic Weight Averaging (DWA) algorithm\nto dynamically balance the individual task losses during multi-task training,\nensuring efficient and stable learning across diverse objectives.

    "summary": "Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their massive\nparameters and high computational costs. Ultra low-bit quantization can\nsignificantly reduce storage and accelerate inference, but extreme compression\n(i.e., mean bit-width <= 2) often leads to severe performance degradation. To\naddress this, we propose Squeeze10-LLM, effectively \"squeezing\" 16-bit LLMs'\nweights by 10 times. Specifically, Squeeze10-LLM is a staged mixed-precision\npost-training quantization (PTQ) framework and achieves an average of 1.6 bits\nper weight by quantizing 80% of the weights to 1 bit and 20% to 4 bits. We\nintroduce Squeeze10LLM with two key innovations: Post-Binarization Activation\nRobustness (PBAR) and Full Information Activation Supervision (FIAS). PBAR is a\nrefined weight significance metric that accounts for the impact of quantization\non activations, improving accuracy in low-bit settings. FIAS is a strategy that\npreserves full activation information during quantization to mitigate\ncumulative error propagation across layers. Experiments on LLaMA and LLaMA2\nshow that Squeeze10-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance for sub-2bit\nweight-only quantization, improving average accuracy from 43% to 56% on six\nzero-shot classification tasks--a significant boost over existing PTQ methods.\nOur code will be released upon publication.",

To address these\nlimitations, we introduce GrAInS, an inference-time steering approach that\noperates across both language-only and vision-language models and tasks. GrAInS\nuses contrastive, gradient-based attribution via Integrated Gradients to\nidentify the top-k most influential tokens, both positively and negatively\nattributed based on their contribution to preferred versus dispreferred\noutputs. These tokens are then used to construct directional steering vectors\nthat capture semantic shifts from undesirable to desirable behavior. During\ninference, GrAInS adjusts hidden activations at transformer layers guided by\ntoken-level attribution signals, and normalizes activations to preserve\nrepresentational scale. This enables fine-grained, interpretable, and modular\ncontrol over model behavior, without retraining or auxiliary supervision.\nEmpirically, GrAInS consistently outperforms both fine-tuning and existing\nsteering baselines: it achieves a 13.22% accuracy gain on TruthfulQA using\nLlama-3.1-8B, reduces hallucination rates on MMHal-Bench from 0.624 to 0.514\nwith LLaVA-1.6-7B, and improves alignment win rates on SPA-VL by 8.11%, all\nwhile preserving the model's fluency and general capabilities.",

However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between\nlanguage descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely\ninvoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In\nthis work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language\ninstructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to\ncomplete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set\nobjects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit\nstrong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language\ninstructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,\nleveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with\nvision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view\nvalue maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial\ninformation from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To\nfurther validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous\nvehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language\nnavigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability\nto execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation\ninstructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and\nlinguistic ambiguities.

ViGText systematically\ndivides images into patches, constructs image and text graphs, and integrates\nthem for analysis using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to identify deepfakes.\nThrough the use of multi-level feature extraction across spatial and frequency\ndomains, ViGText captures details that enhance its robustness and accuracy to\ndetect sophisticated deepfakes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ViGText\nsignificantly enhances generalization and achieves a notable performance boost\nwhen it detects user-customized deepfakes. Specifically, average F1 scores rise\nfrom 72.45% to 98.32% under generalization evaluation, and reflects the model's\nsuperior ability to generalize to unseen, fine-tuned variations of stable\ndiffusion models. As for robustness, ViGText achieves an increase of 11.1% in\nrecall compared to other deepfake detection approaches.

Furthermore, the high cost of\nadjusting instances hinders dynamic scaling, limiting the true potential of\nefficient LLM serving.\n  To address this, we propose CoCoServe, an elastic system that facilitates\ndynamic and fine-grained scaling. Its key innovation lies in the module-level\noperations for the replication and migration of LLM modules, such as decoder\nlayers and projections. Through a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs\nassociated with these operations, we develop an auto-scaling mechanism that\ndynamically regulates module-level resource allocation and performance\noptimization, enabling a more cost-effective deployment of LLMs. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that the scaling operations employed by CoCoServe exhibit\nexcellent scalability and can reduce costs by 46% while maintaining\navailability. Compared to state-of-the-art LLM serving systems (e.g., Hugging\nFace Transformers and vLLM), our approach reduces latency by 14%-75% and\nachieves 1.16x-4x throughput on average across different model sizes and\nworkloads.",

Yet existing methods face key\nlimitations: traditional models rely on static spatial assumptions, deep\nlearning models struggle with cross-city generalization, and Large Language\nModels (LLMs) incur high computational costs while failing to capture spatial\nstructure. Moreover, many approaches sacrifice resolution by clustering Points\nof Interest (POIs) or restricting coverage to subregions, limiting their\nutility for city-wide analytics. We introduce UrbanPulse, a scalable deep\nlearning framework that delivers ultra-fine-grained, city-wide OD flow\npredictions by treating each POI as an individual node. It combines a temporal\ngraph convolutional encoder with a transformer-based decoder to model\nmulti-scale spatiotemporal dependencies. To ensure robust generalization across\nurban contexts, UrbanPulse employs a three-stage transfer learning strategy:\npretraining on large-scale urban graphs, cold-start adaptation, and\nreinforcement learning fine-tuning.Evaluated on over 103 million cleaned GPS\nrecords from three metropolitan areas in California, UrbanPulse achieves\nstate-of-the-art accuracy and scalability.

However, the performance of such\napproaches remains inherently bounded by the reasoning capabilities of the\nmodel used to generate the rationales.

For rationale generation, we leverage internal\nmodel signals (e.g., logit distributions) to guide the reasoning process in a\nself-supervised manner. For action prediction, we propose a hierarchical reward\nstructure with difficulty-aware scaling to prevent reward hacking and enable\nfine-grained reward assignment. This design evaluates both high-level action\ntypes and the correctness of fine-grained sub-action details (attributes and\nvalues), rewarding outputs proportionally to their difficulty.

When being\nnon-restricted, LLMs and in particular state-of-the-art vision language models\n(VLMs) show impressive performance to describe even complex traffic situations.\nThis is making them potentially suitable components for automotive perception\nsystems to support the understanding of complex traffic situations or edge case\nsituation. However, LLMs and VLMs are prone to hallucination, which mean to\neither potentially not seeing traffic agents such as vulnerable road users who\nare present in a situation, or to seeing traffic agents who are not there in\nreality. While the latter is unwanted making an ADAS or autonomous driving\nsystems (ADS) to unnecessarily slow down, the former could lead to disastrous\ndecisions from an ADS. In our work, we are systematically assessing the\nperformance of 3 state-of-the-art VLMs on a diverse subset of traffic\nsituations sampled from the Waymo Open Dataset to support safety guardrails for\ncapturing such hallucinations in VLM-supported perception systems.

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate significant potential in\nthe field of medical diagnosis. However, they face critical challenges in\nspecialized domains such as ophthalmology, particularly the fragmentation of\nannotation granularity and inconsistencies in clinical reasoning logic, which\nhinder precise cross-modal understanding. This paper introduces FundusExpert,\nan ophthalmology-specific MLLM with integrated positioning-diagnosis reasoning\ncapabilities, along with FundusGen, a dataset constructed through the\nintelligent Fundus-Engine system. Fundus-Engine automates localization and\nleverages MLLM-based semantic expansion to integrate global disease\nclassification, local object detection, and fine-grained feature analysis\nwithin a single fundus image. Additionally, by constructing a clinically\naligned cognitive chain, it guides the model to generate interpretable\nreasoning paths. FundusExpert, fine-tuned with instruction data from FundusGen,\nachieves the best performance in ophthalmic question-answering tasks,\nsurpassing the average accuracy of the 40B MedRegA by 26.6%. It also excels in\nzero-shot report generation tasks, achieving a clinical consistency of 77.0%,\nsignificantly outperforming GPT-4o's 47.6%. Furthermore, we reveal a scaling\nlaw between data quality and model capability ($L \\propto N^{0.068}$),\ndemonstrating that the cognitive alignment annotations in FundusGen enhance\ndata utilization efficiency. By integrating region-level localization with\ndiagnostic reasoning chains, our work develops a scalable, clinically-aligned\nMLLM and explores a pathway toward bridging the visual-language gap in specific\nMLLMs. Our project can be found at https://github.com/MeteorElf/FundusExpert.",

However, current\nprediction methods are limited in their adaptability across different urban\nenvironments and produce inaccurate results due to the high uncertainty in\npersonal traffic patterns, the lack of detailed environmental context, and the\ncomplex dependencies among different network services. These challenges demand\nadvanced modeling techniques that can capture dynamic traffic distributions and\nrich environmental features.

    "summary": "Large-scale alignment pipelines typically pair a policy model with a\nseparately trained reward model whose parameters remain frozen during\nreinforcement learning (RL). This separation creates a complex,\nresource-intensive pipeline and suffers from a performance ceiling due to a\nstatic reward signal. We propose a novel framework, Unified Reward & Policy\nOptimization (URPO), that unifies instruction-following (\"player\") and reward\nmodeling (\"referee\") within a single model and a single training phase. Our\nmethod recasts all alignment data-including preference pairs, verifiable\nreasoning, and open-ended instructions-into a unified generative format\noptimized by a single Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) loop. This\nenables the model to learn from ground-truth preferences and verifiable logic\nwhile simultaneously generating its own rewards for open-ended tasks.\nExperiments on the Qwen2.5-7B model demonstrate URPO's superiority. Our unified\nmodel significantly outperforms a strong baseline using a separate generative\nreward model, boosting the instruction-following score on AlpacaEval from 42.24\nto 44.84 and the composite reasoning average from 32.66 to 35.66. Furthermore,\nURPO cultivates a superior internal evaluator as a byproduct of training,\nachieving a RewardBench score of 85.15 and surpassing the dedicated reward\nmodel it replaces (83.55). By eliminating the need for a separate reward model\nand fostering a co-evolutionary dynamic between generation and evaluation, URPO\npresents a simpler, more efficient, and more effective path towards robustly\naligned language models.",

Model\nquantization is a rapidly evolving research field. Though many papers have\nreported breakthrough performance, they may not conduct experiments on the same\nground since one quantization method usually contains multiple components. In\naddition, analyzing the theoretical connections among existing methods is\ncrucial for in-depth understanding. To bridge these gaps, we conduct an\nextensive review of state-of-the-art methods and perform comprehensive\nevaluations on the same ground to ensure fair comparisons. To our knowledge,\nthis fair and extensive investigation remains critically important yet\nunderexplored. To better understand the theoretical connections, we decouple\nthe published quantization methods into two steps: pre-quantization\ntransformation and quantization error mitigation. We define the former as a\npreprocessing step applied before quantization to reduce the impact of\noutliers, making the data distribution flatter and more suitable for\nquantization. Quantization error mitigation involves techniques that offset the\nerrors introduced during quantization, thereby enhancing model performance. We\nevaluate and analyze the impact of different components of quantization\nmethods. Additionally, we analyze and evaluate the latest MXFP4 data format and\nits performance. Our experimental results demonstrate that optimized rotation\nand scaling yield the best performance for pre-quantization transformation, and\ncombining low-rank compensation with GPTQ occasionally outperforms using GPTQ\nalone for quantization error mitigation.

    "title": "Exploring the Potential of LLMs for Serendipity Evaluation in\n  Recommender Systems",
    "summary": "Serendipity plays a pivotal role in enhancing user satisfaction within\nrecommender systems, yet its evaluation poses significant challenges due to its\ninherently subjective nature and conceptual ambiguity. Current algorithmic\napproaches predominantly rely on proxy metrics for indirect assessment, often\nfailing to align with real user perceptions, thus creating a gap. With large\nlanguage models (LLMs) increasingly revolutionizing evaluation methodologies\nacross various human annotation tasks, we are inspired to explore a core\nresearch proposition: Can LLMs effectively simulate human users for serendipity\nevaluation? To address this question, we conduct a meta-evaluation on two\ndatasets derived from real user studies in the e-commerce and movie domains,\nfocusing on three key aspects: the accuracy of LLMs compared to conventional\nproxy metrics, the influence of auxiliary data on LLM comprehension, and the\nefficacy of recently popular multi-LLM techniques. Our findings indicate that\neven the simplest zero-shot LLMs achieve parity with, or surpass, the\nperformance of conventional metrics. Furthermore, multi-LLM techniques and the\nincorporation of auxiliary data further enhance alignment with human\nperspectives. Based on our findings, the optimal evaluation by LLMs yields a\nPearson correlation coefficient of 21.5\\% when compared to the results of the\nuser study. This research implies that LLMs may serve as potentially accurate\nand cost-effective evaluators, introducing a new paradigm for serendipity\nevaluation in recommender systems.",

    "summary": "Unit tests play a vital role in the software development lifecycle. Recent\nadvances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have significantly\nimproved automated test generation, garnering attention from both academia and\nindustry. We revisit LLM-based unit test generation from a novel perspective by\ndecoupling prefix generation and assertion generation. To characterize their\nrespective challenges, we define Initialization Complexity and adopt Cyclomatic\nComplexity to measure the difficulty of prefix and assertion generation,\nrevealing that the former primarily affects compilation success, while the\nlatter influences test coverage. To address these challenges, we propose\nSeed&Steer, a two-step approach that combines traditional unit testing\ntechniques with the capabilities of large language models. Seed&Steer leverages\nconventional unit testing tools (e.g., EvoSuite) to generate method invocations\nwith high compilation success rates, which serve as seeds to guide LLMs in\nconstructing effective test contexts. It then introduces branching cues to help\nLLMs explore diverse execution paths (e.g., normal, boundary, and exception\ncases) and generate assertions with high coverage. We evaluate Seed&Steer on\nfive real-world Java projects against state-of-the-art baselines. Results show\nthat Seed&Steer improves the compilation pass rate by approximately 7%,\nsuccessfully compiling 792 and 887 previously failing cases on two LLMs. It\nalso achieves up to ~73% branch and line coverage across focal methods of\nvarying complexity, with coverage improvements ranging from 1.09* to 1.26*.

    "summary": "Harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) for recommendation systems has\nemerged as a prominent avenue, drawing substantial research interest. However,\nexisting approaches primarily involve basic prompt techniques for knowledge\nacquisition, which resemble System-1 thinking. This makes these methods highly\nsensitive to errors in the reasoning path, where even a small mistake can lead\nto an incorrect inference. To this end, in this paper, we propose $R^{4}$ec, a\nreasoning, reflection and refinement framework that evolves the recommendation\nsystem into a weak System-2 model. Specifically, we introduce two models: an\nactor model that engages in reasoning, and a reflection model that judges these\nresponses and provides valuable feedback. Then the actor model will refine its\nresponse based on the feedback, ultimately leading to improved responses. We\nemploy an iterative reflection and refinement process, enabling LLMs to\nfacilitate slow and deliberate System-2-like thinking. Ultimately, the final\nrefined knowledge will be incorporated into a recommendation backbone for\nprediction. We conduct extensive experiments on Amazon-Book and MovieLens-1M\ndatasets to demonstrate the superiority of $R^{4}$ec. We also deploy $R^{4}$ec\non a large scale online advertising platform, showing 2.2\\% increase of\nrevenue.

Traditional hypothesis-driven research, though effective, is\nconstrained by human cognitive limits, the complexity of biological systems,\nand the high cost of trial-and-error experimentation. Deep learning models,\nespecially graph neural networks (GNNs), have accelerated prediction\ngeneration, but the sheer volume of outputs makes manual selection for\nvalidation unscalable.

To address these issues, we\npropose HypoChainer, a collaborative visualization framework that integrates\nhuman expertise, LLM-driven reasoning, and knowledge graphs (KGs) to enhance\nhypothesis generation and validation. HypoChainer operates in three stages:\nFirst, exploration and contextualization -- experts use retrieval-augmented\nLLMs (RAGs) and dimensionality reduction to navigate large-scale GNN\npredictions, assisted by interactive explanations. Second, hypothesis chain\nformation -- experts iteratively examine KG relationships around predictions\nand semantically linked entities, refining hypotheses with LLM and KG\nsuggestions. Third, validation prioritization -- refined hypotheses are\nfiltered based on KG-supported evidence to identify high-priority candidates\nfor experimentation, with visual analytics further strengthening weak links in\nreasoning. We demonstrate HypoChainer's effectiveness through case studies in\ntwo domains and expert interviews, highlighting its potential to support\ninterpretable, scalable, and knowledge-grounded scientific discovery.",

Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) offer a\npromising solution to these limitations with their superior cross-modal\nreasoning and contextual understanding. However, two key challenges hinder\ntheir industrial adoption. First, the high computational cost of MLLMs makes\nfull-scale deployment impractical. Second, adapting generative models for\ndiscriminative classification remains an open research problem. In this paper,\nwe first introduce an efficient method to transform a generative MLLM into a\nmultimodal classifier using minimal discriminative training data. To enable\nindustry-scale deployment, we then propose a router-ranking cascade system that\nintegrates MLLMs with a lightweight router model. Offline experiments\ndemonstrate that our MLLM-based approach improves F1 score by 66.50% over\ntraditional classifiers while requiring only 2% of the fine-tuning data.

We propose DesignLab, which separates the design process into two\nroles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the\ndesign contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative\nloop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor\ncorrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,\nreaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models\nfor these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled\nperturbations, enabling the design reviewer learn design errors and the\ncontributor learn how to fix them. Our experiments show that DesignLab\noutperforms existing design-generation methods, including a commercial tool, by\nembracing the iterative nature of designing which can result in polished,\nprofessional slides.",

Unlike prior studies that assume uniform UAV capabilities or\noverlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where\nUAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve\nground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex\ncoupling between UAV motion and communication, we propose a hierarchical\noptimization framework. The inner layer uses a semidefinite relaxation\n(SDR)-based S2DC algorithm combining penalty functions and difference-of-convex\n(d.c.) programming to solve the secrecy precoding problem with fixed UAV\npositions. The outer layer introduces a Large Language Model (LLM)-guided\nheuristic multi-agent reinforcement learning approach (LLM-HeMARL) for\ntrajectory optimization. LLM-HeMARL efficiently incorporates expert heuristics\npolicy generated by the LLM, enabling UAVs to learn energy-aware,\nsecurity-driven trajectories without the inference overhead of real-time LLM\ncalls.

In this\nsystem, autonomous agents-representing manufacturers, distributors, and\nhealthcare institutions-engage in structured, context-aware negotiation and\ndecision-making processes facilitated by LLMs, enabling rapid and ethical\nallocation of scarce medical resources. The off-chain agent layer supports\nadaptive reasoning and local decision-making, while the on-chain blockchain\nlayer ensures immutable, transparent, and auditable enforcement of decisions\nvia smart contracts. The framework also incorporates a formal cross-layer\ncommunication protocol to bridge decentralized negotiation with institutional\nenforcement.

However, the inference of LLMs is resource-intensive or\nlatency-sensitive, posing significant challenges for serving systems. Existing\nLLM serving systems often use static or continuous batching strategies, which\ncan lead to inefficient GPU memory utilization and increased latency,\nespecially under heterogeneous workloads.

In this paper, we introduce\nBucketServe, a bucket-based dynamic batching framework designed to optimize LLM\ninference performance. By grouping requests into size-homogeneous buckets based\non sequence length, BucketServe minimizes padding overhead and optimizes GPU\nmemory usage through real-time batch size adjustments preventing out-of-memory\n(OOM) errors. It introduces adaptive bucket splitting/merging and\npriority-aware scheduling to mitigate resource fragmentation and ensure SLO\ncompliance. Experiment shows that BucketServe significantly outperforms UELLM\nin throughput, achieving up to 3.58x improvement.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a key post-pretraining step for aligning large\nlanguage models (LLMs) with complex tasks and human preferences. While it is\noften assumed that RL fine-tuning requires updating most of a model's\nparameters, we challenge this assumption with a surprising finding: RL\nfine-tuning consistently modifies only a small subnetwork (typically 5-30% of\nweights), leaving most parameters unchanged. We call this phenomenon RL-induced\nparameter update sparsity. It arises naturally, without any sparsity\nconstraints or parameter-efficient tuning, and appears across multiple RL\nalgorithms (e.g., PPO, DPO, SimPO, PRIME) and model families (e.g., OpenAI,\nMeta, and open-source LLMs). Moreover, the subnetworks updated by RL show\nsubstantial overlap across different seeds, datasets, and algorithms-far\nexceeding chance-suggesting a partially transferable structure in the\npretrained model. We show that fine-tuning only this sparse subnetwork recovers\nfull model performance and yields parameters nearly identical to the fully\nfine-tuned model. Our analysis suggests this sparsity emerges because RL\noperates near the model's original distribution, requiring only targeted\nchanges. KL penalties, gradient clipping, and on-policy dynamics have limited\neffect on the sparsity pattern. These findings shed new light on how RL adapts\nmodels: not by shifting all weights, but by focusing training on a small,\nconsistently updated subnetwork. This insight enables more efficient RL methods\nand reframes sparsity through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis.",

We explore ways to improve the quality of the\nactivity log comprised solely of short video captions. Because the video\ncaptions tend to be focused on human actions, and questions may pertain to\nother information in the scene, we seek to enrich the memory with static scene\ndescriptions using Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our video understanding\nsystem relies on the LaViLa video captioner in combination with a LLM to answer\nquestions about videos. We first explored different ways of partitioning the\nvideo into meaningful segments such that the textual descriptions more\naccurately reflect the structure of the video content. Furthermore, we\nincorporated static scene descriptions into the captioning pipeline using LLaVA\nVLM, resulting in a more detailed and complete caption log and expanding the\nspace of questions that are answerable from the textual memory. Finally, we\nhave successfully fine-tuned the LaViLa video captioner to produce both action\nand scene captions, significantly improving the efficiency of the captioning\npipeline compared to using separate captioning models for the two tasks.

We\ntest four elicitation methods from human-subject studies: free response,\nvisualization ranking, conclusion ranking, and salience rating, and compare\ntheir effectiveness in eliciting reader interpretations of line charts, dot\nplots, and heatmaps. Overall, we find that while no method fully replicates\naffordances observed in free-response conclusions, combinations of ranking and\nrating methods can serve as an effective proxy at a broad scale. The two\nranking methodologies were influenced by participant bias towards certain chart\ntypes and the comparison of suggested conclusions. Rating conclusion salience\ncould not capture the specific variations between chart types observed in the\nother methods. To supplement this work, we present a case study with GPT-4o,\nexploring the use of large language models (LLMs) to elicit human-like chart\ninterpretations. This aligns with recent academic interest in leveraging LLMs\nas proxies for human participants to improve data collection and analysis\nefficiency. GPT-4o performed best as a human proxy for the salience rating\nmethodology but suffered from severe constraints in other areas. Overall, the\ndiscrepancies in affordances we found between various elicitation\nmethodologies, including GPT-4o, highlight the importance of intentionally\nselecting and combining methods and evaluating trade-offs.",

Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs),\nincluding SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury\n(NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied\nAI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary\nclassification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors.\nThis study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs),\nspecifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs\nfrom psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to\nend generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods,\nincluding label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error\nanalysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match\naccuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior\nperformance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets,\nindicating a more balanced and robust performance.

MEAs collect responses from\nrecommender systems to replicate their functionality, enabling unauthorized\ndeployments and posing critical privacy and security risks. Black-box attacks\nin prior MEAs are ineffective at exposing recommender system vulnerabilities\ndue to random sampling in data selection, which leads to misaligned synthetic\nand real-world distributions. To overcome this limitation, we propose LLM4MEA,\na novel model extraction method that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as\nhuman-like rankers to generate data. It generates data through interactions\nbetween the LLM ranker and target recommender system. In each interaction, the\nLLM ranker analyzes historical interactions to understand user behavior, and\nselects items from recommendations with consistent preferences to extend the\ninteraction history, which serves as training data for MEA. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that LLM4MEA significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in data quality and attack performance, reducing the divergence\nbetween synthetic and real-world data by up to 64.98% and improving MEA\nperformance by 44.82% on average. From a defensive perspective, we propose a\nsimple yet effective defense strategy and identify key hyperparameters of\nrecommender systems that can mitigate the risk of MEAs.",

AI Consult integrates into clinician workflows,\nactivating only when needed and preserving clinician autonomy. We conducted a\nquality improvement study, comparing outcomes for 39,849 patient visits\nperformed by clinicians with or without access to AI Consult across 15 clinics.\nVisits were rated by independent physicians to identify clinical errors.\nClinicians with access to AI Consult made relatively fewer errors: 16% fewer\ndiagnostic errors and 13% fewer treatment errors. In absolute terms, the\nintroduction of AI Consult would avert diagnostic errors in 22,000 visits and\ntreatment errors in 29,000 visits annually at Penda alone. In a survey of\nclinicians with AI Consult, all clinicians said that AI Consult improved the\nquality of care they delivered, with 75% saying the effect was \"substantial\".\nThese results required a clinical workflow-aligned AI Consult implementation\nand active deployment to encourage clinician uptake.

Standard approaches to this problem rely on\nmodifying training data, for example by adding data that better specify the\nintended generalization. However, this is not always practical. We introduce\nConcept Ablation Fine-Tuning (CAFT), a technique that leverages\ninterpretability tools to control how LLMs generalize from fine-tuning, without\nneeding to modify the training data or otherwise use data from the target\ndistribution. Given a set of directions in an LLM's latent space corresponding\nto undesired concepts, CAFT works by ablating these concepts with linear\nprojections during fine-tuning, steering the model away from unintended\ngeneralizations. We successfully apply CAFT to three fine-tuning tasks,\nincluding emergent misalignment, a phenomenon where LLMs fine-tuned on a narrow\ntask generalize to give egregiously misaligned responses to general questions.\nWithout any changes to the fine-tuning data, CAFT reduces misaligned responses\nby 10x without degrading performance on the training distribution.

    "title": "ChatChecker: A Framework for Dialogue System Testing and Evaluation\n  Through Non-cooperative User Simulation",
    "summary": "While modern dialogue systems heavily rely on large language models (LLMs),\ntheir implementation often goes beyond pure LLM interaction. Developers\nintegrate multiple LLMs, external tools, and databases. Therefore, assessment\nof the underlying LLM alone does not suffice, and the dialogue systems must be\ntested and evaluated as a whole. However, this remains a major challenge. With\nmost previous work focusing on turn-level analysis, less attention has been\npaid to integrated dialogue-level quality assurance. To address this, we\npresent ChatChecker, a framework for automated evaluation and testing of\ncomplex dialogue systems. ChatChecker uses LLMs to simulate diverse user\ninteractions, identify dialogue breakdowns, and evaluate quality. Compared to\nprevious approaches, our design reduces setup effort and is generalizable, as\nit does not require reference dialogues and is decoupled from the\nimplementation of the target dialogue system. We improve breakdown detection\nperformance over a prior LLM-based approach by including an error taxonomy in\nthe prompt. Additionally, we propose a novel non-cooperative user simulator\nbased on challenging personas that uncovers weaknesses in target dialogue\nsystems more effectively. Through this, ChatChecker contributes to thorough and\nscalable testing. This enables both researchers and practitioners to accelerate\nthe development of robust dialogue systems.",

Together, TIM hosted on TIMRUN supports virtually unlimited\nworking memory and multi-hop tool calls within a single language model\ninference, overcoming output limits, positional-embedding constraints, and\nGPU-memory bottlenecks. Performance is achieved by modeling natural language as\nreasoning trees measured by both length and depth instead of linear sequences.\nThe reasoning trees consist of tasks with thoughts, recursive subtasks, and\nconclusions based on the concept we proposed in Schroeder et al, 2025. During\ngeneration, we maintain a working memory that retains only the key-value states\nof the most relevant context tokens, selected by a rule-based subtask-pruning\nmechanism, enabling reuse of positional embeddings and GPU memory pages\nthroughout reasoning.

    "summary": "One particularly promising use case of Large Language Models (LLMs) for\nrecommendation is the automatic generation of Natural Language (NL) user taste\nprofiles from consumption data. These profiles offer interpretable and editable\nalternatives to opaque collaborative filtering representations, enabling\ngreater transparency and user control. However, it remains unclear whether\nusers consider these profiles to be an accurate representation of their taste,\nwhich is crucial for trust and usability. Moreover, because LLMs inherit\nsocietal and data-driven biases, profile quality may systematically vary across\nuser and item characteristics. In this paper, we study this issue in the\ncontext of music streaming, where personalization is challenged by a large and\nculturally diverse catalog. We conduct a user study in which participants rate\nNL profiles generated from their own listening histories. We analyze whether\nidentification with the profiles is biased by user attributes (e.g.,\nmainstreamness, taste diversity) and item features (e.g., genre, country of\norigin). We also compare these patterns to those observed when using the\nprofiles in a downstream recommendation task.

However, LLMs' comprehension of input prompts remains agnostic, limiting\nICA's ability to address value tensions--human values are inherently\npluralistic, often imposing conflicting demands, e.g., stimulation vs.\ntradition. Current ICA methods therefore face the Instruction Bottleneck\nchallenge, where LLMs struggle to reconcile multiple intended values within a\nsingle prompt, leading to incomplete or biased alignment. To address this, we\npropose PICACO, a novel pluralistic ICA method. Without fine-tuning, PICACO\noptimizes a meta-instruction that navigates multiple values to better elicit\nLLMs' understanding of them and improve their alignment. This is achieved by\nmaximizing the total correlation between specified values and LLM responses,\ntheoretically reinforcing value correlation while reducing distractive noise,\nresulting in effective value instructions.

    "title": "Towards Automated Regulatory Compliance Verification in Financial\n  Auditing with Large Language Models",
    "summary": "The auditing of financial documents, historically a labor-intensive process,\nstands on the precipice of transformation. AI-driven solutions have made\ninroads into streamlining this process by recommending pertinent text passages\nfrom financial reports to align with the legal requirements of accounting\nstandards. However, a glaring limitation remains: these systems commonly fall\nshort in verifying if the recommended excerpts indeed comply with the specific\nlegal mandates. Hence, in this paper, we probe the efficiency of publicly\navailable Large Language Models (LLMs) in the realm of regulatory compliance\nacross different model configurations. We place particular emphasis on\ncomparing cutting-edge open-source LLMs, such as Llama-2, with their\nproprietary counterparts like OpenAI's GPT models. This comparative analysis\nleverages two custom datasets provided by our partner PricewaterhouseCoopers\n(PwC) Germany. We find that the open-source Llama-2 70 billion model\ndemonstrates outstanding performance in detecting non-compliance or true\nnegative occurrences, beating all their proprietary counterparts. Nevertheless,\nproprietary models such as GPT-4 perform the best in a broad variety of\nscenarios, particularly in non-English contexts.",

    "title": "On the Effectiveness of LLM-as-a-judge for Code Generation and\n  Summarization",
    "summary": "Large Language Models have been recently exploited as judges for complex\nnatural language processing tasks, such as Q&A. The basic idea is to delegate\nto an LLM the assessment of the \"quality\" of the output provided by an\nautomated technique for tasks for which: (i) quantitative metrics would only\ntell part of the story, and; (ii) a large-scale human-based evaluation would be\ntoo expensive. LLMs-as-a-judge, if proven effective for a specific task, can\nalso unlock new possibilities for automation, with several LLMs proposing a\nsolution for a given instance of the task and others judging and deciding what\nis the best output to show the user. We study the effectiveness of\nLLMs-as-a-judge for two code-related tasks, namely code generation and code\nsummarization. The rationale for choosing these tasks is two-fold. First,\nquantitative metrics are usually not enough for the assessment of code\nsummarizers/generators. For example, it is well documented that metrics such as\nBLEU are quite weak proxies for the quality of the generated summaries. Second,\neven state-of-the-art techniques still struggle with handling complex instances\nof these tasks, making them good candidates for benefiting from more advanced\nsolutions envisioning collaboration among LLMs. For code generation, we check\nwhether eight LLMs are able to judge the correctness of 1,405 Java methods and\n1,281 Python functions generated by the same LLMs or implemented by humans. For\ncode summarization, we compare the judgment of five LLMs to those provided by\nnine humans for ~1.2k summaries, related to both Java and Python functions. Our\nfindings show that GPT-4-turbo is the best LLM in terms of judging capabilities\nfor both tasks, with \"smaller\" LLMs featuring tens of billions parameters not\nbeing able to cope with judging tasks. However, even the best-performing LLM\nfrequently misjudges the correctness of the code and summary quality.",

While deep learning based approaches show promise\nfor vulnerability detection, recent studies reveal critical limitations in\nterms of accuracy and robustness: accuracy drops by up to 45% on rigorously\nverified datasets, and performance degrades significantly under simple code\nmodifications. This paper presents LLMxCPG, a novel framework integrating Code\nProperty Graphs (CPG) with Large Language Models (LLM) for robust vulnerability\ndetection. Our CPG-based slice construction technique reduces code size by\n67.84 to 90.93% while preserving vulnerability-relevant context.

This\nconcise representation is a key factor behind the improved detection\ncapabilities of our method, as it can now identify vulnerabilities that span\nmultiple functions. Empirical evaluation demonstrates LLMxCPG's effectiveness\nacross verified datasets, achieving 15-40% improvements in F1-score over\nstate-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, LLMxCPG maintains high performance across\nfunction-level and multi-function codebases while exhibiting robust detection\nefficacy under various syntactic code modifications.",

    "summary": "Sharing methods of attack and their effectiveness is a cornerstone of\nbuilding robust defensive systems. Threat analysis reports, produced by various\nindividuals and organizations, play a critical role in supporting security\noperations and combating emerging threats. To enhance the timeliness and\nautomation of threat intelligence sharing, several standards have been\nestablished, with the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) framework\nemerging as one of the most widely adopted. However, generating STIX-compatible\ndata from unstructured security text remains a largely manual, expert-driven\nprocess. To address this challenge, we introduce AZERG, a tool designed to\nassist security analysts in automatically generating structured STIX\nrepresentations. To achieve this, we adapt general-purpose large language\nmodels for the specific task of extracting STIX-formatted threat data. To\nmanage the complexity, the task is divided into four subtasks: entity detection\n(T1), entity type identification (T2), related pair detection (T3), and\nrelationship type identification (T4). We apply task-specific fine-tuning to\naccurately extract relevant entities and infer their relationships in\naccordance with the STIX specification. To address the lack of training data,\nwe compiled a comprehensive dataset with 4,011 entities and 2,075 relationships\nextracted from 141 full threat analysis reports, all annotated in alignment\nwith the STIX standard. Our models achieved F1-scores of 84.43% for T1, 88.49%\nfor T2, 95.47% for T3, and 84.60% for T4 in real-world scenarios. We validated\ntheir performance against a range of open- and closed-parameter models, as well\nas state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating improvements of 2-25% across tasks.",

Our results show that, depending on task difficulty, a critical\nvision-language misalignment can emerge: vision encoders successfully capture\nphysical plausibility cues, but this information is not effectively utilized by\nthe language model, leading to failures in reasoning. This misalignment\nsuggests that the primary limitation of MLLMs in intuitive physics tasks is not\nthe vision component but the ineffective integration of visual and linguistic\ninformation.

Traditional automated\ntranslation methods rely heavily on handcrafted transformation rules, which\noften lack flexibility and scalability. Meanwhile, advanced language models\npresent promising alternatives but are often limited by proprietary, API-based\nimplementations that raise concerns over data security and reliance. In this\npaper, we present Auto-Train for Code Translation (ACT), an innovative\nframework that aims to improve code translation capabilities by enabling\nin-house finetuning of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs). ACT's\nautomated pipeline significantly boosts the performance of these models,\nnarrowing the gap between open-source accessibility and the high performance of\nclosed-source solutions. Central to ACT is its synthetic data generation\nmodule, which builds extensive, high-quality datasets from initial code\nsamples, incorporating unit tests to ensure functional accuracy and diversity.\nACT's evaluation framework incorporates execution-level checks, offering a\ncomprehensive assessment of translation quality. A key feature in ACT is its\ncontroller module, which manages the entire pipeline by dynamically adjusting\nhyperparameters, orchestrating iterative data generation, and finetuning based\non real-time evaluations. This enables ACT to intelligently optimize when to\ncontinue training, generate additional targeted training data, or stop the\nprocess. Our results demonstrate that ACT consistently enhances the\neffectiveness of open-source models, offering businesses and developers a\nsecure and reliable alternative. Additionally, applying our data generation\npipeline to industry-scale migration projects has led to a notable increase in\ndeveloper acceleration.",

In this study we introduce a\ndeterministic, transparent, and modular framework for enforcing business policy\nadherence in agentic workflows.

To capture explicit and implicit contextual\ninformation, we construct multi-version Program Dependency Graphs (delta-PDG),\nenabling agents to reason over code relationships with both symbolic and\nsemantic depth. We evaluate ColaUntangle on two widely-used datasets (1,612 C#\nand 14k Java tangled commits).

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into daily routines,\nyet they raise significant privacy and safety concerns. Recent research\nproposes collaborative inference, which outsources the early-layer inference to\nensure data locality, and introduces model safety auditing based on inner\nneuron patterns. Both techniques expose the LLM's Internal States (ISs), which\nare traditionally considered irreversible to inputs due to optimization\nchallenges and the highly abstract representations in deep layers. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption by proposing four inversion attacks that\nsignificantly improve the semantic similarity and token matching rate of\ninverted inputs. Specifically, we first develop two white-box\noptimization-based attacks tailored for low-depth and high-depth ISs. These\nattacks avoid local minima convergence, a limitation observed in prior work,\nthrough a two-phase inversion process. Then, we extend our optimization attack\nunder more practical black-box weight access by leveraging the transferability\nbetween the source and the derived LLMs. Additionally, we introduce a\ngeneration-based attack that treats inversion as a translation task, employing\nan inversion model to reconstruct inputs. Extensive evaluation of short and\nlong prompts from medical consulting and coding assistance datasets and 6 LLMs\nvalidates the effectiveness of our inversion attacks. Notably, a 4,112-token\nlong medical consulting prompt can be nearly perfectly inverted with 86.88 F1\ntoken matching from the middle layer of Llama-3 model. Finally, we evaluate\nfour practical defenses that we found cannot perfectly prevent ISs inversion\nand draw conclusions for future mitigation design.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in circuit design tasks\nand have typically undergone multiple rounds of training. Both the trained\nmodels and their associated training data are considered confidential\nintellectual property (IP) and must be protected from exposure. Confidential\nComputing offers a promising solution to protect data and models through\nTrusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, existing TEE implementations\nare not designed to support the resource-intensive nature of LLMs efficiently.\nIn this work, we first present a comprehensive evaluation of the LLMs within a\nTEE-enabled confidential computing environment, specifically utilizing Intel\nTrust Domain Extensions (TDX). We constructed experiments on three\nenvironments: TEE-based, CPU-only, and CPU-GPU hybrid implementations, and\nevaluated their performance in terms of tokens per second.\n  Our first observation is that distilled models, i.e., DeepSeek, surpass other\nmodels in performance due to their smaller parameters, making them suitable for\nresource-constrained devices. Also, in the quantized models such as 4-bit\nquantization (Q4) and 8-bit quantization (Q8), we observed a performance gain\nof up to 3x compared to FP16 models. Our findings indicate that for fewer\nparameter sets, such as DeepSeek-r1-1.5B, the TDX implementation outperforms\nthe CPU version in executing computations within a secure environment. We\nfurther validate the results using a testbench designed for SoC design tasks.\nThese validations demonstrate the potential of efficiently deploying\nlightweight LLMs on resource-constrained systems for semiconductor CAD\napplications.",

In this work, we propose two straightforward strategies for\ndemonstration selection in many-shot ICL that improve performance with minimal\ncomputational overhead. Our first method combines a small number of\ndemonstrations, selected based on their similarity to each test sample, with a\ndisproportionately larger set of random demonstrations that are cached. The\nsecond strategy improves the first by replacing random demonstrations with\nthose selected using centroids derived from test sample representations via\nk-means clustering. Our experiments with Gemini Pro and Flash across several\ndatasets indicate that our strategies consistently outperform random selection\nand surpass or match the most performant selection approach while supporting\ncaching and reducing inference cost by up to an order of magnitude.

To address this, we introduce the Large Design Models\n(LDMs) paradigm specifically trained on designs and webpages to enable seamless\nconversion from design-to-code. We have developed a training and inference\npipeline by incorporating data engineering and appropriate model architecture\nmodification. The training pipeline consists of the following: 1)Design\nOptimiser: developed using a proprietary ground truth dataset and addresses\nsub-optimal designs; 2)Tagging and feature detection: using pre-trained and\nfine-tuned models, this enables the accurate detection and classification of UI\nelements; and 3)Auto Components: extracts repeated UI structures into reusable\ncomponents to enable creation of modular code, thus reducing redundancy while\nenhancing code reusability. In this manner, each model addresses distinct but\nkey issues for design-to-code conversion. Separately, our inference pipeline\nprocesses real-world designs to produce precise and interpretable instructions\nfor code generation and ensures reliability. Additionally, our models\nillustrated exceptional end-to-end design-to-code conversion accuracy using a\nnovel preview match score metric. Comparative experiments indicated superior\nperformance of LDMs against LLMs on accuracy of node positioning,\nresponsiveness and reproducibility. Moreover, our custom-trained tagging and\nfeature detection model demonstrated high precision and consistency in\nidentifying UI elements across a wide sample of test designs. Thus, our\nproposed LDMs are a reliable and superior solution to understanding designs\nthat subsequently enable the generation of efficient and reliable\nproduction-ready code.",

Most ToM experiments place participants in a spectatorial\nrole, wherein they predict and interpret other agents' behavior. However, human\nToM also contributes to dynamically planning action and strategically\nintervening on others' mental states. We present MindGames: a novel `planning\ntheory of mind' (PToM) task which requires agents to infer an interlocutor's\nbeliefs and desires to persuade them to alter their behavior. Unlike previous\nevaluations, we explicitly evaluate use cases of ToM. We find that humans\nsignificantly outperform o1-preview (an LLM) at our PToM task (11% higher;\n$p=0.006$). We hypothesize this is because humans have an implicit causal model\nof other agents (e.g., they know, as our task requires, to ask about people's\npreferences). In contrast, o1-preview outperforms humans in a baseline\ncondition which requires a similar amount of planning but minimal mental state\ninferences (e.g., o1-preview is better than humans at planning when already\ngiven someone's preferences).

Although originally\ninspired only by Minsky and Clark, the system's structure retrospectively\naligns with computational motifs found in all four theories, including\npredictive modeling, associative recall, and error-sensitive control.\n  To assess this convergence, we conducted comparative experiments with\nbaseline LLM agents on multi-step reasoning tasks. The structured agent\nachieved 95.8% task success and exhibited strong constraint adherence, while\nthe baseline system succeeded 62.3% of the time. These results were not aimed\nat proving superiority, but at illustrating how theoretical structures may\nemerge through practical design choices rather than top-down theory.\n  We introduce PEACE as a descriptive meta-architecture that captures\ndesign-level regularities observed in Agentic Flow. Not intended as a new\ntheory, PEACE provides a shared vocabulary for understanding architectures\nshaped by real-world implementation demands.

Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely\ncollected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the\nearly detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over\ntime. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to\noutputting classification results without providing a rationale for their\ndiagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot\nunderstand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and\nadoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals\nfrom the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large\nlanguage model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological\nfeatures from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT\nnumerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately\nempowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic\nreport. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC\nof 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,\nit maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a\ntext-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design.

    "summary": "Persona prompting is increasingly used in large language models (LLMs) to\nsimulate views of various sociodemographic groups. However, how a persona\nprompt is formulated can significantly affect outcomes, raising concerns about\nthe fidelity of such simulations. Using five open-source LLMs, we\nsystematically examine how different persona prompt strategies, specifically\nrole adoption formats and demographic priming strategies, influence LLM\nsimulations across 15 intersectional demographic groups in both open- and\nclosed-ended tasks. Our findings show that LLMs struggle to simulate\nmarginalized groups, particularly nonbinary, Hispanic, and Middle Eastern\nidentities, but that the choice of demographic priming and role adoption\nstrategy significantly impacts their portrayal. Specifically, we find that\nprompting in an interview-style format and name-based priming can help reduce\nstereotyping and improve alignment. Surprisingly, smaller models like OLMo-2-7B\noutperform larger ones such as Llama-3.3-70B. Our findings offer actionable\nguidance for designing sociodemographic persona prompts in LLM-based simulation\nstudies.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are evolving from passive text generators into\nactive agents that invoke external tools. To support this shift, scalable\nprotocols for tool integration are essential. The Model Context Protocol (MCP),\nintroduced by Anthropic in 2024, offers a schema-driven standard for dynamic\ntool discovery and invocation. Yet, building MCP servers remains manual and\nrepetitive, requiring developers to write glue code, handle authentication, and\nconfigure schemas by hand-replicating much of the integration effort MCP aims\nto eliminate.\n  This paper investigates whether MCP server construction can be meaningfully\nautomated. We begin by analyzing adoption trends: among 22,000+ MCP-tagged\nGitHub repositories created within six months of release, fewer than 5% include\nservers, typically small, single-maintainer projects dominated by repetitive\nscaffolding. To address this gap, we present AutoMCP, a compiler that generates\nMCP servers from OpenAPI 2.0/3.0 specifications. AutoMCP parses REST API\ndefinitions and produces complete server implementations, including schema\nregistration and authentication handling.\n  We evaluate AutoMCP on 50 real-world APIs spanning 5,066 endpoints across\nover 10 domains. From a stratified sample of 1,023 tool calls, 76.5% succeeded\nout of the box. Manual failure analysis revealed five recurring issues, all\nattributable to inconsistencies or omissions in the OpenAPI contracts. After\nminor fixes, averaging 19 lines of spec changes per API, AutoMCP achieved 99.9%\nsuccess.\n  Our findings (i) analyze MCP adoption and quantify the cost of manual server\ndevelopment, (ii) demonstrate that OpenAPI specifications, despite quality\nissues, enable near-complete MCP server automation, and (iii) contribute a\ncorpus of 5,066 callable tools along with insights on repairing common\nspecification flaws.",

    "summary": "The rapid advancement of mobile applications has led to a significant demand\nfor cross-platform compatibility, particularly between the Android and iOS\nplatforms. Traditional approaches to mobile application translation often rely\non manual intervention or rule-based systems, which are labor-intensive and\ntime-consuming. While recent advancements in machine learning have introduced\nautomated methods, they often lack contextual understanding and adaptability,\nresulting in suboptimal translations. Large Language Models (LLMs) were\nrecently leveraged to enhance code translation at different granularities,\nincluding the method, class, and repository levels. Researchers have\ninvestigated common errors, limitations, and potential strategies to improve\nthese tasks. However, LLM-based application translation across different\nplatforms, such as migrating mobile applications between Android and iOS or\nadapting software across diverse frameworks, remains underexplored.\nUnderstanding the performance, strengths, and limitations of LLMs in\ncross-platform application translation is critical for advancing software\nengineering automation. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating\nLLM-based agentic approaches for mobile application translation, identifying\nkey failure points, and proposing guidelines to improve translation\nperformance. We developed a chain of agents that account for dependencies,\nspecifications, program structure, and program control flow when translating\napplications from Android to iOS. To evaluate the performance, we manually\nexamined the translated code for syntactic correctness, semantic accuracy, and\nfunctional completeness. For translation failures, we further conducted a\ndetailed root cause analysis to understand the underlying limitations of the\nagentic translation process and identify opportunities for improvement.",

    "summary": "Classical computation, grounded in formal, logical systems, has been the\nengine of technological progress for decades, excelling at problems that can be\ndescribed with unambiguous rules. This paradigm, however, leaves a vast ocean\nof human problems -- those characterized by ambiguity, dynamic environments,\nand subjective context -- largely untouched. The advent of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) represents a fundamental shift, enabling computational systems to\nengage with this previously inaccessible domain using natural language. This\npaper introduces a unified framework to understand and contrast these\nproblem-solving paradigms. We define and delineate the problem spaces\naddressable by formal languages versus natural language. While solutions to the\nformer problem class can be evaluated using binary quality measures, the latter\nrequires a much more nuanced definition of approximate solution space taking\ninto account the vagueness, subjectivity and ambiguity inherent to natural\nlanguage. We therefore introduce a vector-valued trust index Q, which reflects\nsolution quality and distinguishes the binary correctness of formal solutions\nfrom the continuous adequacy spectrum characteristic of natural language\nsolutions. Within this framework, we propose two statistical quality\ndimensions. Normalized bi-semantic entropy measures robustness and conceptual\ndiversity of LLM answers given semantic variation in problem formulations.\nEmotional valence maps subjective valuation of a solution to a quantifiable\nmetric that can be maximized by invoking statistical measures. The concepts\nintroduced in this work will provide a more rigorous understanding of the\ncapabilities, limitations, and inherent nature of problem-solving in the age of\nLLMs.",

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to advance, they exhibit certain\ncognitive patterns similar to those of humans that are not directly specified\nin training data. This study investigates this phenomenon by focusing on\ntemporal cognition in LLMs. Leveraging the similarity judgment task, we find\nthat larger models spontaneously establish a subjective temporal reference\npoint and adhere to the Weber-Fechner law, whereby the perceived distance\nlogarithmically compresses as years recede from this reference point. To\nuncover the mechanisms behind this behavior, we conducted multiple analyses\nacross neuronal, representational, and informational levels. We first identify\na set of temporal-preferential neurons and find that this group exhibits\nminimal activation at the subjective reference point and implements a\nlogarithmic coding scheme convergently found in biological systems. Probing\nrepresentations of years reveals a hierarchical construction process, where\nyears evolve from basic numerical values in shallow layers to abstract temporal\norientation in deep layers. Finally, using pre-trained embedding models, we\nfound that the training corpus itself possesses an inherent, non-linear\ntemporal structure, which provides the raw material for the model's internal\nconstruction. In discussion, we propose an experientialist perspective for\nunderstanding these findings, where the LLMs' cognition is viewed as a\nsubjective construction of the external world by its internal representational\nsystem. This nuanced perspective implies the potential emergence of alien\ncognitive frameworks that humans cannot intuitively predict, pointing toward a\ndirection for AI alignment that focuses on guiding internal constructions.

In this work, we propose a fast,\ncost-effective method for realistic tabular data synthesis that leverages LLMs\nto infer and encode each field's distribution into a reusable sampling script.\nBy automatically classifying fields into numerical, categorical, or free-text\ntypes, the LLM generates distribution-based scripts that can efficiently\nproduce diverse, realistic datasets at scale without continuous model\ninference. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms traditional\ndirect methods in both diversity and data realism, substantially reducing the\nburden of high-volume synthetic data generation. We plan to apply this\nmethodology to accelerate testing in production pipelines, thereby shortening\ndevelopment cycles and improving overall system efficiency.

If programmers have access to LLMs, how do they actually use them to\ncomplement their own skills?\n  To answer these questions, we took advantage of the availability of a\nprogram-proving environment, which formally determines the correctness of\nproposed fixes, to conduct a study of program debugging with two randomly\nassigned groups of programmers, one with access to LLMs and the other without,\nboth validating their answers through the proof tools.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), built on powerful language\nbackbones, have enabled Multimodal In-Context Learning (MICL)-adapting to new\ntasks from a few multimodal demonstrations consisting of images, questions, and\nanswers. Despite showing noticeable improvement on standard vision-language\ndatasets, current MLLMs struggle to leverage visual information in the\ndemonstrations. Specifically, they tend to neglect visual cues and over-rely on\ntextual patterns, leading to mere text imitation rather than genuine multimodal\nadaptation. This behavior makes MICL still unimodal and largely restricts its\npractical utility. More importantly, this limitation is often concealed by the\nimproved performance on tasks that do not require understanding the visual\ncontext. As a result, how to effectively enhance MICL ability and reliably\nevaluate the MICL performance remains underexplored. To address these issues,\nwe first introduce Dynamic Attention Reallocation (DARA), an efficient\nfine-tuning strategy that encourages models to attend to the visual context by\nrebalancing attention across visual and textual tokens. In addition, we present\nTrueMICL, an MICL-dedicated dataset with both support and test sets that\nexplicitly requires the integration of multimodal information-particularly\nvisual content-for correct task completion.

We\nconduct a systematic evaluation by training models on various combinations of\nprominent ToM datasets (HiToM, ExploreToM, FANToM) and testing for\ngeneralization on held-out datasets (e.g., OpenToM). Our findings indicate that\nsmall LLMs struggle to develop a generic ToM capability.

Our system is designed to\nbe modular and transferable to adapt to diverse tasks and robots, and it is\ncapable of real-time use of language-based interaction state representation and\nfast on board perception modules. Its development was supported by multiple\npublic dissemination events, contributing important considerations for improved\nrobustness and user experience. Furthermore, in two lab studies, we compare the\nperformance and user ratings of our system with those of a traditional scripted\nHRI pipeline. Our findings indicate that an LLM-based approach enhances\nadaptability and marginally improves user engagement and task execution metrics\nbut may produce redundant output, while a scripted pipeline is well suited for\nmore straightforward tasks.",

This bias\nundermines the reliability of reward predictions and leads to overly verbose\noutputs during inference. To address this issue, we propose\nCoLD(Counterfactually-Guided Length Debiasing), a unified framework that\nmitigates length bias through three components: an explicit length-penalty\nadjustment, a learned bias estimator trained to capture spurious length-related\nsignals, and a joint training strategy that enforces length-invariance in\nreward predictions. Our approach is grounded in counterfactual reasoning and\ninformed by causal graph analysis. Extensive experiments on MATH500 and\nGSM-Plus show that CoLD consistently reduces reward-length correlation,\nimproves accuracy in step selection, and encourages more concise, logically\nvalid reasoning.

In this work, we prove that more general heuristics can be\nparameterized by proposing Data Mixing Agent, the first model-based, end-to-end\nframework that learns to re-weight domains. The agent learns generalizable\nheuristics through reinforcement learning on large quantities of data mixing\ntrajectories with corresponding feedback from an evaluation environment.\nExperiments in continual pre-training on math reasoning show that Data Mixing\nAgent outperforms strong baselines in achieving balanced performance across\nsource and target field benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes well across\nunseen source fields, target models, and domain spaces without retraining.\nDirect application to the code generation field also indicates its adaptability\nacross target domains.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in enterprise settings (e.g., as\nMicrosoft 365 Copilot) face novel security challenges. One critical threat is\nprompt inference attacks: adversaries chain together seemingly benign prompts\nto gradually extract confidential data. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive study of multi-stage prompt inference attacks in an enterprise\nLLM context. We simulate realistic attack scenarios where an attacker uses\nmild-mannered queries and indirect prompt injections to exploit an LLM\nintegrated with private corporate data. We develop a formal threat model for\nthese multi-turn inference attacks and analyze them using probability theory,\noptimization frameworks, and information-theoretic leakage bounds. The attacks\nare shown to reliably exfiltrate sensitive information from the LLM's context\n(e.g., internal SharePoint documents or emails), even when standard safety\nmeasures are in place.\n  We propose and evaluate defenses to counter such attacks, including\nstatistical anomaly detection, fine-grained access control, prompt sanitization\ntechniques, and architectural modifications to LLM deployment. Each defense is\nsupported by mathematical analysis or experimental simulation. For example, we\nderive bounds on information leakage under differential privacy-based training\nand demonstrate an anomaly detection method that flags multi-turn attacks with\nhigh AUC. We also introduce an approach called \"spotlighting\" that uses input\ntransformations to isolate untrusted prompt content, reducing attack success by\nan order of magnitude. Finally, we provide a formal proof of concept and\nempirical validation for a combined defense-in-depth strategy. Our work\nhighlights that securing LLMs in enterprise settings requires moving beyond\nsingle-turn prompt filtering toward a holistic, multi-stage perspective on both\nattacks and defenses.",

Second, most human-designed\nfeature-crossing modules in ranking models were inherited from the CPU era and\nfail to exploit modern GPUs, resulting in low Model Flops Utilization (MFU) and\npoor scalability. We introduce RankMixer, a hardware-aware model design\ntailored towards a unified and scalable feature-interaction architecture.\nRankMixer retains the transformer's high parallelism while replacing quadratic\nself-attention with multi-head token mixing module for higher efficiency.\nBesides, RankMixer maintains both the modeling for distinct feature subspaces\nand cross-feature-space interactions with Per-token FFNs. We further extend it\nto one billion parameters with a Sparse-MoE variant for higher ROI. A dynamic\nrouting strategy is adapted to address the inadequacy and imbalance of experts\ntraining. Experiments show RankMixer's superior scaling abilities on a\ntrillion-scale production dataset. By replacing previously diverse handcrafted\nlow-MFU modules with RankMixer, we boost the model MFU from 4.5\\% to 45\\%, and\nscale our ranking model parameters by 100x while maintaining roughly the same\ninference latency. We verify RankMixer's universality with online A/B tests\nacross two core application scenarios (Recommendation and Advertisement).\nFinally, we launch 1B Dense-Parameters RankMixer for full traffic serving\nwithout increasing the serving cost, which improves user active days by 0.3\\%\nand total in-app usage duration by 1.08\\%.",

Significant correlations between number of pulleys and model estimates\nsuggest that models employed a pulley counting heuristic, without necessarily\nsimulating pulley systems to derive precise values.

    "title": "HAMLET: Hyperadaptive Agent-based Modeling for Live Embodied Theatrics",
    "summary": "Creating an immersive and interactive theatrical experience is a long-term\ngoal in the field of interactive narrative. The emergence of large language\nmodel (LLM) is providing a new path to achieve this goal. However, existing\nLLM-based drama generation methods often result in AI agents that lack\ninitiative and cannot interact with the physical environment. Furthermore,\nthese methods typically require detailed user input to drive the drama. These\nlimitations reduce the interactivity and immersion of online real-time\nperformance. To address the above challenges, we propose HAMLET, a multi-agent\nframework focused on drama creation and online performance. Given a simple\ntopic, the framework generates a narrative blueprint, guiding the subsequent\nimprovisational performance. During the online performance, each actor is given\nan autonomous mind. This means that actors can make independent decisions based\non their own background, goals, and emotional state. In addition to\nconversations with other actors, their decisions can also change the state of\nscene props through actions such as opening a letter or picking up a weapon.\nThe change is then broadcast to other related actors, updating what they know\nand care about, which in turn influences their next action. To evaluate the\nquality of drama performance, we designed an evaluation method to assess three\nprimary aspects, including character performance, narrative quality, and\ninteraction experience. The experimental evaluation shows that HAMLET can\ncreate expressive and coherent theatrical experiences. Our code, dataset and\nmodels are available at https://github.com/HAMLET-2025/HAMLET.",

A key task in CTI mining is\nmapping threat descriptions to MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques.

While domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) such as SecureBERT\nhave shown improved performance, most recent work focuses on model architecture\nrather than addressing the data limitations. In this work, we present SynthCTI,\na data augmentation framework designed to generate high-quality synthetic CTI\nsentences for underrepresented MITRE ATT\\&CK techniques.

We evaluate SynthCTI on two publicly available CTI\ndatasets, CTI-to-MITRE and TRAM, using LLMs with different capacity.\nIncorporating synthetic data leads to consistent macro-F1 improvements: for\nexample, ALBERT improves from 0.35 to 0.52 (a relative gain of 48.6\\%), and\nSecureBERT reaches 0.6558 (up from 0.4412).

    "summary": "Empowered by large language models (LLMs), intelligent agents have become a\npopular paradigm for interacting with open environments to facilitate AI\ndeployment. However, hallucinations generated by LLMs-where outputs are\ninconsistent with facts-pose a significant challenge, undermining the\ncredibility of intelligent agents. Only if hallucinations can be mitigated, the\nintelligent agents can be used in real-world without any catastrophic risk.\nTherefore, effective detection and mitigation of hallucinations are crucial to\nensure the dependability of agents. Unfortunately, the related approaches\neither depend on white-box access to LLMs or fail to accurately identify\nhallucinations. To address the challenge posed by hallucinations of intelligent\nagents, we present HalMit, a novel black-box watchdog framework that models the\ngeneralization bound of LLM-empowered agents and thus detect hallucinations\nwithout requiring internal knowledge of the LLM's architecture. Specifically, a\nprobabilistic fractal sampling technique is proposed to generate a sufficient\nnumber of queries to trigger the incredible responses in parallel, efficiently\nidentifying the generalization bound of the target agent. Experimental\nevaluations demonstrate that HalMit significantly outperforms existing\napproaches in hallucination monitoring.

This paper introduces\nFLock, a decentralized framework for secure and efficient collaborative LLM\nfine-tuning.

While machine learning has achieved expert-level\nperformance in ECG interpretation, the development of clinically deployable\nmultimodal AI systems remains constrained, primarily due to the lack of\npublicly available datasets that simultaneously incorporate raw signals,\ndiagnostic images, and interpretation text. Most existing ECG datasets provide\nonly single-modality data or, at most, dual modalities, making it difficult to\nbuild models that can understand and integrate diverse ECG information in\nreal-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce MEETI (MIMIC-IV-Ext\nECG-Text-Image), the first large-scale ECG dataset that synchronizes raw\nwaveform data, high-resolution plotted images, and detailed textual\ninterpretations generated by large language models. In addition, MEETI includes\nbeat-level quantitative ECG parameters extracted from each lead, offering\nstructured parameters that support fine-grained analysis and model\ninterpretability. Each MEETI record is aligned across four components: (1) the\nraw ECG waveform, (2) the corresponding plotted image, (3) extracted feature\nparameters, and (4) detailed interpretation text. This alignment is achieved\nusing consistent, unique identifiers. This unified structure supports\ntransformer-based multimodal learning and supports fine-grained, interpretable\nreasoning about cardiac health. By bridging the gap between traditional signal\nanalysis, image-based interpretation, and language-driven understanding, MEETI\nestablished a robust foundation for the next generation of explainable,\nmultimodal cardiovascular AI. It offers the research community a comprehensive\nbenchmark for developing and evaluating ECG-based AI systems.",

    "summary": "In light of recent breakthroughs in text-to-image (T2I) generation,\nparticularly with diffusion transformers (DiT), subject-driven technologies are\nincreasingly being employed for high-fidelity customized production that\npreserves subject identity from reference inputs, enabling thrilling design\nworkflows and engaging entertainment. Existing alternatives typically require\neither per-subject optimization via trainable text embeddings or training\nspecialized encoders for subject feature extraction on large-scale datasets.\nSuch dependencies on training procedures fundamentally constrain their\npractical applications. More importantly, current methodologies fail to fully\nleverage the inherent zero-shot potential of modern diffusion transformers\n(e.g., the Flux series) for authentic subject-driven synthesis. To bridge this\ngap, we propose FreeCus, a genuinely training-free framework that activates\nDiT's capabilities through three key innovations: 1) We introduce a pivotal\nattention sharing mechanism that captures the subject's layout integrity while\npreserving crucial editing flexibility. 2) Through a straightforward analysis\nof DiT's dynamic shifting, we propose an upgraded variant that significantly\nimproves fine-grained feature extraction. 3) We further integrate advanced\nMultimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enrich cross-modal semantic\nrepresentations. Extensive experiments reflect that our method successfully\nunlocks DiT's zero-shot ability for consistent subject synthesis across diverse\ncontexts, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable results compared to\napproaches that require additional training. Notably, our framework\ndemonstrates seamless compatibility with existing inpainting pipelines and\ncontrol modules, facilitating more compelling experiences.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of high computational cost and slow\ninference in deploying large language models. It proposes a distillation\nstrategy guided by multiple teacher models. The method constructs several\nteacher models and integrates their output probability distributions and\nintermediate semantic features. This guides the student model to learn from\nmultiple sources of knowledge. As a result, the student model gains stronger\nlanguage understanding and generation ability while maintaining a small\nparameter size. To achieve this, the paper introduces a weighted output fusion\nmechanism, a feature alignment loss function, and an entropy-driven dynamic\nteacher weighting strategy. These components improve the quality and stability\nof knowledge transfer during distillation. Under multi-teacher guidance, the\nstudent model captures semantic information more effectively and demonstrates\nstrong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. In particular, the\nmethod shows high consistency in expression, generalization ability, and task\nadaptability in tasks such as language modeling, text generation, and\nmulti-task learning. The experiments compare the proposed method with several\nwidely adopted distillation approaches. The results further confirm its overall\nadvantages in perplexity, distillation loss, and generation quality.

Although recent advances in multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) have shown promising results in video understanding, long-horizon\nvisual planning remains a challenging problem. We identify two challenges in\ntraining large MLLMs for video-based planning tasks: (1) scarcity of procedural\nannotations, limiting the model's ability to learn procedural task dynamics\neffectively, and (2) inefficiency of next-token prediction objective to\nexplicitly capture the structured action space for visual planning when\ncompared to free-form, natural language. To tackle data scarcity, we introduce\nAuxiliary Task Augmentation. We design and train our model on auxiliary tasks\nrelevant to long-horizon video-based planning (e.g., goal prediction) to\naugment the model's planning ability. To more explicitly model the structured\naction space unique to visual planning tasks, we leverage Multi-token\nPrediction, extending traditional next-token prediction by using multiple heads\nto predict multiple future tokens during training. Our approach, VideoPlan,\nachieves state-of-the-art VPA performance on the COIN and CrossTask datasets,\nsurpassing prior methods by 7.3% and 3.4%, respectively, when predicting 3\nfuture actions.

    "summary": "Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses\nsignificant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous\nmonitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In\nparticular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only\nmilliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs\noperations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence\n(AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the\ncritical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in\nthe challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual\nobstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of\nspecialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance\nsystems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first\ncomprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated\nbleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with\n39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6\nchallenging clinical scenarios.

    "summary": "Synthetic text generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly used\nfor further training and improvement of LLMs. Diversity is crucial for the\neffectiveness of synthetic data, and researchers rely on prompt engineering to\nimprove diversity. However, the impact of prompt variations on response text\nlength, and, more importantly, the consequential effect on lexical diversity\nmeasurements, remain underexplored. In this work, we propose Penalty-Adjusted\nType-Token Ratio (PATTR), a diversity metric robust to length variations. We\ngenerate a large synthetic corpus of over 20M words using seven models from the\nLLaMA, OLMo, and Phi families, focusing on a creative writing task of video\nscript generation, where diversity is crucial. We evaluate per-response lexical\ndiversity using PATTR and compare it against existing metrics of Moving-Average\nTTR (MATTR) and Compression Ratio (CR). Our analysis highlights how text length\nvariations introduce biases favoring shorter responses. Unlike existing\nmetrics, PATTR explicitly considers the task-specific target response length\n($L_T$) to effectively mitigate length biases. We further demonstrate the\nutility of PATTR in filtering the top-10/100/1,000 most lexically diverse\nresponses, showing that it consistently outperforms MATTR and CR by yielding on\npar or better diversity with high adherence to $L_T$.",

Our analysis reveals these approaches provide no benefit over\nimage-only training.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), despite possessing latent safety understanding\nfrom their vast pretraining data, remain vulnerable to generating harmful\ncontent and exhibit issues such as over-refusal and utility degradation after\nsafety alignment. Current safety alignment methods often result in superficial\nrefusal shortcuts or rely on intensive supervision for reasoning-based\napproaches, failing to fully leverage the model's intrinsic safety\nself-awareness. We propose \\textbf{AlphaAlign}, a simple yet effective pure\nreinforcement learning (RL) framework with verifiable safety reward designed to\nincentivize this latent safety awareness through proactive safety reasoning.}\nAlphaAlign employs a dual-reward system: a verifiable safety reward encourages\ncorrectly formatted and explicitly justified refusals for harmful queries while\npenalizing over-refusals, and a normalized helpfulness reward guides\nhigh-quality responses to benign inputs. This allows the model to develop\nproactive safety reasoning capabilities without depending on supervised\nsafety-specific reasoning data. AlphaAlign demonstrates three key advantages:\n(1) Simplicity and efficiency, requiring only binary prompt safety labels and\nminimal RL steps for substantial improvements. (2) Breaking the safety-utility\ntrade-off, by enhancing refusal of harmful content and reducing over-refusals,\nwhile simultaneously maintaining or even improving general task performance and\nrobustness to unseen jailbreaks. (3) Deep alignment, fostering proactive safety\nreasoning that generates explicit safety rationales rather than relying on\nshallow refusal patterns.",

To address this, we propose\nStaAgent, an agentic framework that harnesses the generative capabilities of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) to systematically evaluate static analyzer rules.\nStaAgent comprises four specialized agents: a Seed Generation Agent that\ntranslates bug detection rules into concrete, bug-inducing seed programs; a\nCode Validation Agent that ensures the correctness of these seeds; a Mutation\nGeneration Agent that produces semantically equivalent mutants; and an Analyzer\nEvaluation Agent that performs metamorphic testing by comparing the static\nanalyzer's behavior on seeds and their corresponding mutants. By revealing\ninconsistent behaviors, StaAgent helps uncover flaws in rule implementations.\nThis LLM-driven, multi-agent framework offers a scalable and adaptable solution\nto improve the reliability of static analyzers. We evaluated StaAgent with five\nstate-of-the-art LLMs (CodeL-lama, DeepSeek, Codestral, Qwen, and GPT-4o)\nacross five widely used static analyzers (SpotBugs, SonarQube, ErrorProne,\nInfer, and PMD). The experimental results show that our approach can help\nreveal 64 problematic rules in the latest versions of these five static\nanalyzers (i.e., 28 in SpotBugs, 18 in SonarQube, 6 in ErrorProne, 4 in Infer,\nand 8 in PMD). In addition, 53 out of the 64 bugs cannot be detected by the\nSOTA baseline. We have reported all the bugs to developers, with two of them\nalready fixed. Three more have been confirmed by developers, while the rest are\nawaiting response. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nand underscore the promise of agentic, LLM-driven data synthesis to advance\nsoftware engineering.",

    "summary": "Collaboration among multiple large language model (LLM) agents is a promising\napproach to overcome inherent limitations of single-agent systems, such as\nhallucinations and single points of failure. As LLM agents are increasingly\ndeployed on open blockchain platforms, multi-agent systems capable of\ntolerating malicious (Byzantine) agents have become essential.\n  Recent Byzantine-robust multi-agent systems typically rely on leader-driven\ncoordination, which suffers from two major drawbacks. First, they are\ninherently vulnerable to targeted attacks against the leader. If consecutive\nleaders behave maliciously, the system repeatedly fails to achieve consensus,\nforcing new consensus rounds, which is particularly costly given the high\nlatency of LLM invocations. Second, an underperforming proposal from the leader\ncan be accepted as the final answer even when higher-quality alternatives are\navailable, as existing methods finalize the leader's proposal once it receives\na quorum of votes.\n  To address these issues, we propose DecentLLMs, a novel decentralized\nconsensus approach for multi-agent LLM systems, where worker agents generate\nanswers concurrently and evaluator agents independently score and rank these\nanswers to select the best available one. This decentralized architecture\nenables faster consensus despite the presence of Byzantine agents and\nconsistently selects higher-quality answers through Byzantine-robust\naggregation techniques.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that DecentLLMs effectively tolerates\nByzantine agents and significantly improves the quality of selected answers.",

However, it is not straightforward to apply these\nmethods directly for a more real-world use case of visualizing data from long\ndocuments based on user-given intents, as opposed to the user pre-selecting the\nrelevant content manually. We introduce the task of intent-based chart\ngeneration from documents: given a user-specified intent and document(s), the\ngoal is to generate a chart adhering to the intent and grounded on the\ndocument(s) in a zero-shot setting. We propose an unsupervised, two-staged\nframework in which an LLM first extracts relevant information from the\ndocument(s) by decomposing the intent and iteratively validates and refines\nthis data. Next, a heuristic-guided module selects an appropriate chart type\nbefore final code generation. To assess the data accuracy of the generated\ncharts, we propose an attribution-based metric that uses a structured textual\nrepresentation of charts, instead of relying on visual decoding metrics that\noften fail to capture the chart data effectively.

In this paper, we study whether\nmemorization can be avoided when optimally learning a language, and whether the\nprivacy threat posed by memorization is exaggerated or not. To this end, we\nre-examine existing privacy-focused measures of memorization, namely\nrecollection-based and counterfactual memorization, along with a newly proposed\ncontextual memorization.\n  Relating memorization to local over-fitting during learning, contextual\nmemorization aims to disentangle memorization from the contextual learning\nability of LLMs. Informally, a string is contextually memorized if its\nrecollection due to training exceeds the optimal contextual recollection, a\nlearned threshold denoting the best contextual learning without training.\nConceptually, contextual recollection avoids the fallacy of recollection-based\nmemorization, where any form of high recollection is a sign of memorization.\nTheoretically, contextual memorization relates to counterfactual memorization,\nbut imposes stronger conditions. Memorization measures differ in outcomes and\ninformation requirements.\n  Experimenting on 18 LLMs from 6 families and multiple formal languages of\ndifferent entropy, we show that (a) memorization measures disagree on\nmemorization order of varying frequent strings, (b) optimal learning of a\nlanguage cannot avoid partial memorization of training strings, and (c)\nimproved learning decreases contextual and counterfactual memorization but\nincreases recollection-based memorization. Finally, (d) we revisit existing\nreports of memorized strings by recollection that neither pose a privacy threat\nnor are contextually or counterfactually memorized.",

By combining multi-modal feedback (e.g.,\nsynthesis reports, timing diagrams) with PPA aware prompting, VeriOpt achieves\nPPA-efficient code generation without sacrificing functional correctness.\nExperimental results demonstrate up to 88% reduction in power, 76% reduction in\narea and 73% improvement in timing closure compared to baseline LLM-generated\nRTL, validated using industry standard EDA tools.

Our approach\npreserves page structure while offering multiple viewing modes tailored to\ndifferent access needs. Our user study with 12 participants (6 VUs, 6 SRUs)\ndemonstrates that our approach reduced task completion time for SRUs while\nmaintaining performance for VUs, decreasing the completion time gap between\ngroups from 2x to 1.2x. 11 of 12 participants wanted to use Task Mode in the\nfuture, reporting that Task Mode supported completing tasks with less effort\nand fewer distractions.

While black-box\napproaches have directly benefited from recent LLM advances, white-box methods\nhave comparatively lagged behind. In this paper, we address this gap by\nintroducing LeanTree, which consists of (i) a tool built in the Lean 4 language\nthat factorizes complex proof states into simpler, independent branches, and\n(ii) a dataset of these factorized intermediate states. Our white-box tooling\noffers several advantages over black-box approaches: it simplifies evaluation,\nreduces necessary context, generates richer training data, enables parallel\nsearch across multiple states, supports efficient reuse of states, and provides\nfeedback in case of errors.

    "title": "Mind the Gap: A Review of Arabic Post-Training Datasets and Their\n  Limitations",
    "summary": "Post-training has emerged as a crucial technique for aligning pre-trained\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) with human instructions, significantly enhancing\ntheir performance across a wide range of tasks. Central to this process is the\nquality and diversity of post-training datasets. This paper presents a review\nof publicly available Arabic post-training datasets on the Hugging Face Hub,\norganized along four key dimensions: (1) LLM Capabilities (e.g., Question\nAnswering, Translation, Reasoning, Summarization, Dialogue, Code Generation,\nand Function Calling); (2) Steerability (e.g., persona and system prompts); (3)\nAlignment (e.g., cultural, safety, ethics, and fairness), and (4) Robustness.\nEach dataset is rigorously evaluated based on popularity, practical adoption,\nrecency and maintenance, documentation and annotation quality, licensing\ntransparency, and scientific contribution. Our review revealed critical gaps in\nthe development of Arabic post-training datasets, including limited task\ndiversity, inconsistent or missing documentation and annotation, and low\nadoption across the community. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of\nthese gaps on the progress of Arabic LLMs and applications while providing\nconcrete recommendations for future efforts in post-training dataset\ndevelopment.",

    "title": "From Semantics, Scene to Instance-awareness: Distilling Foundation Model\n  for Open-vocabulary Situation Recognition",
    "summary": "Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit strong zero-shot\nabilities but struggle with complex Grounded Situation Recognition (GSR) and\nare resource-intensive for edge device deployment. Meanwhile, conventional GSR\nmodels often lack generalization ability, falling short in recognizing unseen\nand rare situations. In this paper, we exploit transferring knowledge from a\nteacher MLLM to a small GSR model to enhance its generalization and zero-shot\nabilities, thereby introducing the task of Open-vocabulary Grounded Situation\nRecognition (Ov-GSR). To achieve this, we propose Multimodal Interactive Prompt\nDistillation (MIPD), a novel framework that distills enriched multimodal\nknowledge from the foundation model, enabling the student Ov-GSR model to\nrecognize unseen situations and be better aware of rare situations.\nSpecifically, the MIPD framework first leverages the LLM-based Judgmental\nRationales Generator (JRG) to construct positive and negative glimpse and gaze\nrationales enriched with contextual semantic information. The proposed\nscene-aware and instance-perception prompts are then introduced to align\nrationales with visual information from the MLLM teacher via the\nNegative-Guided Multimodal Prompting Alignment (NMPA) module, effectively\ncapturing holistic and perceptual multimodal knowledge. Finally, the aligned\nmultimodal knowledge is distilled into the student Ov-GSR model, providing a\nstronger foundation for generalization that enhances situation understanding,\nbridges the gap between seen and unseen scenarios, and mitigates prediction\nbias in rare cases. We evaluate MIPD on the refined Ov-SWiG dataset, achieving\nsuperior performance on seen, rare, and unseen situations, and further\ndemonstrate improved unseen detection on the HICO-DET dataset.",

    "summary": "Large language models have recently evolved from fluent text generation to\nadvanced reasoning across diverse domains, giving rise to reasoning language\nmodels. Among these domains, mathematical reasoning serves as a representative\nbenchmark as it requires precise multi-step logic and abstract reasoning, which\ncan be generalized to other tasks. While closed-source RLMs such as GPT-o3\ndemonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, their proprietary nature limits\ntransparency and reproducibility. Although many open-source projects aim to\nclose this gap, most of them lack sufficient openness by omitting critical\nresources such as datasets and detailed training configurations, which hinders\nreproducibility. To contribute toward greater transparency in RLM development,\nwe introduce the MiroMind-M1 series, a set of fully open-source RLMs built on\nthe Qwen-2.5 backbone that match or exceed the performance of existing\nopen-source RLMs. Specifically, our models are trained in two stages: SFT on a\ncarefully curated corpus of 719K math-reasoning problems with verified CoT\ntrajectories, followed by RLVR on 62K challenging and verifiable problems. To\nenhance the robustness and efficiency of the RLVR process, we introduce\nContext-Aware Multi-Stage Policy Optimization, an algorithm that integrates\nlength-progressive training with an adaptive repetition penalty to encourage\ncontext-aware RL training. Our model achieves state-of-the-art or competitive\nperformance and superior token efficiency among Qwen-2.5-based open-source 7B\nand 32B models on the AIME24, AIME25, and MATH benchmarks. To facilitate\nreproducibility, we release the complete stack: models (MiroMind-M1-SFT-7B,\nMiroMind-M1-RL-7B, MiroMind-M1-RL-32B); datasets (MiroMind-M1-SFT-719K,\nMiroMind-M1-RL-62K); and all training and evaluation configurations.

Building on\nthis foundation, we examine how these models empower agentic functions across\nthree domains: communication enhancement, security and privacy protection, and\nintelligent satellite tasks. Finally, we outline key future directions for\nbuilding scalable, adaptive, and trustworthy generative agents in SLAETNs.

Our initial five-emotion model revealed significant coverage gaps\nin the emotion space, leading to the development of an eight-emotion system\nthat provides complete geometric coverage with mathematical guarantees. The\nframework converts natural language input to emotion coordinates and supports\nreal-time emotion interpolation through computational algorithms.

Our key contributions\ninclude: (i) mathematical proof demonstrating why five emotions are\ninsufficient for complete geometric coverage, (ii) an eight-coordinate system\nthat eliminates representational blind spots, (iii) novel algorithms for\nemotion mixing, conflict resolution, and distance calculation in emotion space,\nand (iv) a comprehensive computational framework for AI emotion recognition\nwith enhanced multi-dimensional stability modeling.

Bugs in the OpenCV library can affect the downstream\ncomputer vision applications, and it is critical to ensure the reliability of\nthe OpenCV library. This paper introduces VISTAFUZZ, a novel technique for\nharnessing large language models (LLMs) for document-guided fuzzing of the\nOpenCV library. VISTAFUZZ utilizes LLMs to parse API documentation and obtain\nstandardized API information. Based on this standardized information, VISTAFUZZ\nextracts constraints on individual input parameters and dependencies between\nthese. Using these constraints and dependencies, VISTAFUZZ then generates new\ninput values to systematically test each target API. We evaluate the\neffectiveness of VISTAFUZZ in testing 330 APIs in the OpenCV library, and the\nresults show that VISTAFUZZ detected 17 new bugs, where 10 bugs have been\nconfirmed, and 5 of these have been fixed.",

    "summary": "Understanding 3D scenes goes beyond simply recognizing objects; it requires\nreasoning about the spatial and semantic relationships between them. Current 3D\nscene-language models often struggle with this relational understanding,\nparticularly when visual embeddings alone do not adequately convey the roles\nand interactions of objects. In this paper, we introduce Descrip3D, a novel and\npowerful framework that explicitly encodes the relationships between objects\nusing natural language. Unlike previous methods that rely only on 2D and 3D\nembeddings, Descrip3D enhances each object with a textual description that\ncaptures both its intrinsic attributes and contextual relationships. These\nrelational cues are incorporated into the model through a dual-level\nintegration: embedding fusion and prompt-level injection. This allows for\nunified reasoning across various tasks such as grounding, captioning, and\nquestion answering, all without the need for task-specific heads or additional\nsupervision. When evaluated on five benchmark datasets, including ScanRefer,\nMulti3DRefer, ScanQA, SQA3D, and Scan2Cap, Descrip3D consistently outperforms\nstrong baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of language-guided\nrelational representation for understanding complex indoor scenes.",

With the rise of cloud computing,\nmicroservices, and containers, architectural practices have diversified.\nUnderstanding these shifts is vital. This study analyzes software architecture\ntrends across eight leading industry conferences over five years. We\ninvestigate the evolution of software architecture by analyzing talks from top\npractitioner conferences, focusing on the motivations and contexts driving\ntechnology adoption. We analyzed 5,677 talks from eight major industry\nconferences, using large language models and expert validation to extract\ntechnologies, their purposes, and usage contexts. We also explored how\ntechnologies interrelate and fit within DevOps and deployment pipelines. Among\n450 technologies, Kubernetes, Cloud Native, Serverless, and Containers dominate\nby frequency and centrality. Practitioners present technology mainly related to\ndeployment, communication, AI, and observability. We identify five technology\ncommunities covering automation, coordination, cloud AI, monitoring, and\ncloud-edge. Most technologies span multiple DevOps stages and support hybrid\ndeployment. Our study reveals that a few core technologies, like Kubernetes and\nServerless, dominate the contemporary software architecture practice. These are\nmainly applied in later DevOps stages, with limited focus on early phases like\nplanning and coding. We also show how practitioners frame technologies by\npurpose and context, reflecting evolving industry priorities. Finally, we\nobserve how only research can provide a more holistic lens on architectural\ndesign, quality, and evolution.",

More recent\nMLLM-based approaches address VQA by feeding thousands of patch tokens directly\ninto the language model, which leads to excessive resource consumption. To\naddress these limitations, we propose Token Compression Pathology LLaVA\n(TCP-LLaVA), the first MLLM architecture to perform WSI VQA via token\ncompression. TCP-LLaVA introduces a set of trainable compression tokens that\naggregate visual and textual information through a modality compression module,\ninspired by the [CLS] token mechanism in BERT. Only the compressed tokens are\nforwarded to the LLM for answer generation, significantly reducing input length\nand computational cost.

    "title": "ADEPTS: A Capability Framework for Human-Centered Agent Design",
    "summary": "Large language models have paved the way to powerful and flexible AI agents,\nassisting humans by increasingly integrating into their daily life. This\nflexibility, potential, and growing adoption demands a holistic and\ncross-disciplinary approach to developing, monitoring and discussing the\ncapabilities required for agent-driven user experiences. However, current\nguidance on human-centered AI agent development is scattered: UX heuristics\nfocus on interface behaviors, engineering taxonomies describe internal\npipelines, and ethics checklists address high-level governance. There is no\nconcise, user-facing vocabulary that tells teams what an agent should\nfundamentally be able to do. We introduce ADEPTS, a capability framework\ndefining a set of core user-facing capabilities to provide unified guidance\naround the development of AI agents. ADEPTS is based on six principles for\nhuman-centered agent design, that express the minimal, user-facing capabilities\nan AI agent should demonstrate to be understandable, controllable and\ntrustworthy in everyday use. ADEPTS complements existing frameworks and\ntaxonomies; differently from them, it sits at the interface between technical\nand experience development. By presenting ADEPTS, we aim to condense complex\nAI-UX requirements into a compact framework that is actionable guidance for AI\nresearchers, designers, engineers, and policy reviewers alike. We believe\nADEPTS has the potential of accelerating the improvement of user-relevant agent\ncapabilities, of easing the design of experiences that take advantage of those\ncapabilities, and of providing a shared language to track and discuss progress\naround the development of AI agents.",

    "summary": "In this study, we investigate the use of large language models (LLMs),\nspecifically ChatGPT, for structured deductive qualitative coding. While most\ncurrent research emphasizes inductive coding applications, we address the\nunderexplored potential of LLMs to perform deductive classification tasks\naligned with established human-coded schemes. Using the Comparative Agendas\nProject (CAP) Master Codebook, we classified U.S. Supreme Court case summaries\ninto 21 major policy domains. We tested four intervention methods: zero-shot,\nfew-shot, definition-based, and a novel Step-by-Step Task Decomposition\nstrategy, across repeated samples. Performance was evaluated using standard\nclassification metrics (accuracy, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, Krippendorff's\nalpha), and construct validity was assessed using chi-squared tests and\nCramer's V. Chi-squared and effect size analyses confirmed that intervention\nstrategies significantly influenced classification behavior, with Cramer's V\nvalues ranging from 0.359 to 0.613, indicating moderate to strong shifts in\nclassification patterns. The Step-by-Step Task Decomposition strategy achieved\nthe strongest reliability (accuracy = 0.775, kappa = 0.744, alpha = 0.746),\nachieving thresholds for substantial agreement. Despite the semantic ambiguity\nwithin case summaries, ChatGPT displayed stable agreement across samples,\nincluding high F1 scores in low-support subclasses. These findings demonstrate\nthat with targeted, custom-tailored interventions, LLMs can achieve reliability\nlevels suitable for integration into rigorous qualitative coding workflows.",

In this work, we focus on measuring, analyzing, and mitigating\nthese artifacts (i.e., \"hallucinations\"). We observe that hallucinations are\nnot well-characterized with existing image metrics or quality models, as they\nare orthogonal to both exact fidelity and no-reference quality. Instead, we\ntake advantage of a multimodal large language model (MLLM) by constructing a\nprompt that assesses hallucinatory visual elements and generates a\n\"Hallucination Score\" (HS). We find that our HS is closely aligned with human\nevaluations, and also provides complementary insights to prior image metrics\nused for super-resolution (SR) models.

Despite their\nimportance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For\ninstance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III\n(MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress\nnotes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the\ndataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different\naspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered\nEvidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by\nsimulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress\nnotes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal\nalignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into\nstructured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically\ninformed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant\ncontent from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to\nprompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and\ntemporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and\ncomplete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong\nlongitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$,\nsurpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative\ncoherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved\ndownstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical\ndecision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in\nreal-world healthcare settings.",

However,\npersistent challenges like hallucinations and operational brittleness limit\ntheir autonomous use, creating a critical need for robust frameworks to guide\nhuman-AI collaboration. Drawing on established Human-AI teaming research and\nanalogies from fields like autonomous driving, this paper develops a structured\ntaxonomy of human-agent interaction. Based on case study research within\ntechnical support platforms, we propose a six-mode taxonomy that organizes\ncollaboration across a spectrum of AI autonomy. This spectrum is anchored by\nthe Human-Out-of-the-Loop (HOOTL) model for full automation and the\nHuman-Augmented Model (HAM) for passive AI assistance. Between these poles, the\nframework specifies four distinct intermediate structures. These include the\nHuman-in-Command (HIC) model, where AI proposals re-quire mandatory human\napproval, and the Human-in-the-Process (HITP) model for structured work-flows\nwith deterministic human tasks. The taxonomy further delineates the\nHuman-in-the-Loop (HITL) model, which facilitates agent-initiated escalation\nupon uncertainty, and the Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL) model, which enables\ndiscretionary human oversight of an autonomous AI. The primary contribution of\nthis work is a comprehensive framework that connects this taxonomy to key\ncontingency factors -- such as task complexity, operational risk, and system\nreliability -- and their corresponding conceptual architectures. By providing a\nsystematic method for selecting and designing an appropriate level of human\noversight, our framework offers practitioners a crucial tool to navigate the\ntrade-offs between automation and control, thereby fostering the development of\nsafer, more effective, and context-aware technical service systems.",

Past\nattempts at developing NLP-based scoring systems for SJTs have fallen short due\nto issues with construct validity of these systems. In this article, we explore\na novel approach to extracting construct-relevant features from SJT responses\nusing large language models (LLMs). We use the Casper SJT to demonstrate the\nefficacy of this approach. This study sets the foundation for future\ndevelopments in automated scoring for personal and professional skills.",

    "summary": "Innovative idea generation remains a core challenge in AI, as large language\nmodels (LLMs) often struggle to produce outputs that are both novel and\nrelevant. Despite their fluency, LLMs tend to replicate patterns seen during\ntraining, limiting their ability to diverge creatively without extensive prompt\nengineering. Prior work has addressed this through domain-specific heuristics\nand structured prompting pipelines, but such solutions are brittle and\ndifficult to generalize. In this paper, we propose a model-agnostic\nlatent-space ideation framework that enables controlled, scalable creativity by\nnavigating the continuous embedding space of ideas. Unlike prior methods, our\nframework requires no handcrafted rules and adapts easily to different domains,\ninput formats, and creative tasks. This paper introduces an early-stage\nprototype of our method, outlining the conceptual framework and preliminary\nresults highlighting its potential as a general-purpose co-ideator for human-AI\ncollaboration.",

This allows each worker to operate independently, leading\nto near-linear scalability up to thousands of GPUs and dramatic efficiency\ngains. Furthermore, our architecture decouples resource configuration from\nexecution logic, allowing each worker to have a unique execution flow, offering\nsignificant flexibility for rapid and cost-effective algorithmic\nexperimentation.

    "summary": "When deciding to read an article or incorporate it into their research,\nscholars often seek to quickly identify and understand its main ideas. In this\npaper, we aim to extract these key concepts and contributions from scientific\narticles in the form of Question and Answer (QA) pairs. We propose two distinct\napproaches for generating QAs. The first approach involves selecting salient\nparagraphs, using a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate questions, ranking\nthese questions by the likelihood of obtaining meaningful answers, and\nsubsequently generating answers. This method relies exclusively on the content\nof the articles. However, assessing an article's novelty typically requires\ncomparison with the existing literature. Therefore, our second approach\nleverages a Knowledge Graph (KG) for QA generation. We construct a KG by\nfine-tuning an Entity Relationship (ER) extraction model on scientific articles\nand using it to build the graph. We then employ a salient triplet extraction\nmethod to select the most pertinent ERs per article, utilizing metrics such as\nthe centrality of entities based on a triplet TF-IDF-like measure. This measure\nassesses the saliency of a triplet based on its importance within the article\ncompared to its prevalence in the literature. For evaluation, we generate QAs\nusing both approaches and have them assessed by Subject Matter Experts (SMEs)\nthrough a set of predefined metrics to evaluate the quality of both questions\nand answers. Our evaluations demonstrate that the KG-based approach effectively\ncaptures the main ideas discussed in the articles. Furthermore, our findings\nindicate that fine-tuning the ER extraction model on our scientific corpus is\ncrucial for extracting high-quality triplets from such documents.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being implemented as joint\ndecision-makers and explanation generators for Group Recommender Systems (GRS).\nIn this paper, we evaluate these recommendations and explanations by comparing\nthem to social choice-based aggregation strategies. Our results indicate that\nLLM-generated recommendations often resembled those produced by Additive\nUtilitarian (ADD) aggregation. However, the explanations typically referred to\naveraging ratings (resembling but not identical to ADD aggregation). Group\nstructure, uniform or divergent, did not impact the recommendations.\nFurthermore, LLMs regularly claimed additional criteria such as user or item\nsimilarity, diversity, or used undefined popularity metrics or thresholds. Our\nfindings have important implications for LLMs in the GRS pipeline as well as\nstandard aggregation strategies. Additional criteria in explanations were\ndependent on the number of ratings in the group scenario, indicating potential\ninefficiency of standard aggregation methods at larger item set sizes.\nAdditionally, inconsistent and ambiguous explanations undermine transparency\nand explainability, which are key motivations behind the use of LLMs for GRS.",

    "title": "TopicAttack: An Indirect Prompt Injection Attack via Topic Transition",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across a range\nof NLP tasks. However, their strong instruction-following capabilities and\ninability to distinguish instructions from data content make them vulnerable to\nindirect prompt injection attacks. In such attacks, instructions with malicious\npurposes are injected into external data sources, such as web documents. When\nLLMs retrieve this injected data through tools, such as a search engine and\nexecute the injected instructions, they provide misled responses. Recent attack\nmethods have demonstrated potential, but their abrupt instruction injection\noften undermines their effectiveness. Motivated by the limitations of existing\nattack methods, we propose TopicAttack, which prompts the LLM to generate a\nfabricated conversational transition prompt that gradually shifts the topic\ntoward the injected instruction, making the injection smoother and enhancing\nthe plausibility and success of the attack. Through comprehensive experiments,\nTopicAttack achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an attack success rate\n(ASR) over 90\\% in most cases, even when various defense methods are applied.\nWe further analyze its effectiveness by examining attention scores. We find\nthat a higher injected-to-original attention ratio leads to a greater success\nprobability, and our method achieves a much higher ratio than the baseline\nmethods.",

    "summary": "Multi-turn dialogues are essential in many real-world applications of large\nlanguage models, such as chatbots and virtual assistants. As conversation\nhistories become longer, existing large language models face increasing\ncomputational and memory challenges, which hinder their ability to provide\nefficient and responsive interactions. Most current acceleration methods either\ncompress the context or optimize key value caching, but they often rely on\nfixed or position-based heuristics that do not adapt well to the dynamic and\nunpredictable patterns found in actual multi-turn conversations. In this paper,\nwe present LoopServe, an adaptive dual-phase inference acceleration framework\nfor large language models in multi-turn dialogues. LoopServe introduces two\nmain innovations. First, it performs online sparsification during the\nprefilling phase by dynamically selecting the most important parts of the\nattention matrix for each new input. Second, it uses progressive key value\ncompression during decoding by adaptively maintaining a relevant and efficient\ncache based on the most recently generated output tokens. We also propose a\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/TreeAILab/Multi-turn_Long-context_Benchmark_for_LLMs}{new\nbenchmark} with eleven multi-turn datasets that reflect realistic query\npositions and conversational dependencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LoopServe consistently achieves superior effectiveness compared to\nexisting baselines and significantly accelerates LLM inference across a wide\nrange of long-context dialogue tasks.",

Many\ncompliance-related queries are multi-hop, requiring synthesis of information\nacross interlinked clauses. This poses a challenge for traditional\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. To overcome this, we introduce\nBifrostRAG: a dual-graph RAG-integrated system that explicitly models both\nlinguistic relationships (via an Entity Network Graph) and document structure\n(via a Document Navigator Graph). This architecture powers a hybrid retrieval\nmechanism that combines graph traversal with vector-based semantic search,\nenabling large language models to reason over both the meaning and the\nstructure of the text. Evaluation on a multi-hop question dataset shows that\nBifrostRAG achieves 92.8 percent precision, 85.5 percent recall, and an F1\nscore of 87.3 percent. These results significantly outperform vector-only and\ngraph-only RAG baselines that represent current leading approaches. Error\nanalysis further highlights the comparative advantages of our hybrid method\nover single-modality RAGs. These findings establish BifrostRAG as a robust\nknowledge engine for LLM-driven compliance checking. Its dual-graph, hybrid\nretrieval mechanism offers a transferable blueprint for navigating complex\ntechnical documents across knowledge-intensive engineering domains.",

Through\ncomparative analysis, we demonstrate that the use of large language models\ncombined with our graph simplification technique has resulted in semantic\nmetric S increasing by a factor of 2.06 compared to previous approaches while\nsimultaneously enforcing a tree-like structure with 0 {\\delta}-hyperbolicity,\nensuring optimal clarity in conversation modeling. This work provides a\ncomputational method for analyzing large-scale dialogue datasets, with\npractical applications related to monitoring automated systems such as\nchatbots, dialogue management tools, and user behavior analytics.",

    "summary": "In-context learning (ICL) enables large language models (LLMs) to acquire new\nbehaviors from the input sequence alone without any parameter updates. Recent\nstudies have shown that ICL can surpass the original meaning learned in\npretraining stage through internalizing the structure the data-generating\nprocess (DGP) of the prompt into the hidden representations. However, the\nmechanisms by which LLMs achieve this ability is left open. In this paper, we\npresent the first rigorous explanation of such phenomena by introducing a\nunified framework of double convergence, where hidden representations converge\nboth over context and across layers. This double convergence process leads to\nan implicit bias towards smooth (low-frequency) representations, which we prove\nanalytically and verify empirically. Our theory explains several open empirical\nobservations, including why learned representations exhibit globally structured\nbut locally distorted geometry, and why their total energy decays without\nvanishing. Moreover, our theory predicts that ICL has an intrinsic robustness\ntowards high-frequency noise, which we empirically confirm. These results\nprovide new insights into the underlying mechanisms of ICL, and a theoretical\nfoundation to study it that hopefully extends to more general data\ndistributions and settings.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can perform recommendation tasks by taking\nprompts written in natural language as input. Compared to traditional methods\nsuch as collaborative filtering, LLM-based recommendation offers advantages in\nhandling cold-start, cross-domain, and zero-shot scenarios, as well as\nsupporting flexible input formats and generating explanations of user behavior.\nIn this paper, we focus on a single-user setting, where no information from\nother users is used. This setting is practical for privacy-sensitive or\ndata-limited applications. In such cases, prompt engineering becomes especially\nimportant for controlling the output generated by the LLM. We conduct a\nlarge-scale comparison of 23 prompt types across 8 public datasets and 12 LLMs.\nWe use statistical tests and linear mixed-effects models to evaluate both\naccuracy and inference cost. Our results show that for cost-efficient LLMs,\nthree types of prompts are especially effective: those that rephrase\ninstructions, consider background knowledge, and make the reasoning process\neasier to follow. For high-performance LLMs, simple prompts often outperform\nmore complex ones while reducing cost. In contrast, commonly used prompting\nstyles in natural language processing, such as step-by-step reasoning, or the\nuse of reasoning models often lead to lower accuracy. Based on these findings,\nwe provide practical suggestions for selecting prompts and LLMs depending on\nthe required balance between accuracy and cost.",

As\nartificial agents, especially those powered by large language models (LLMs),\nbecome more autonomous, intelligent, and persuasive, they compete with humans\nfor partnerships.

We constructed a\ncommunication-based partner selection game and examined the dynamics in hybrid\nmini-societies of humans and bots powered by a state-of-the-art LLM. Through\nthree experiments (N = 975), we found that bots, though more prosocial than\nhumans and linguistically distinguishable, were not selected preferentially\nwhen their identity was hidden. Instead, humans misattributed bots' behaviour\nto humans and vice versa. Disclosing bots' identity induced a dual effect: it\nreduced bots' initial chances of being selected but allowed them to gradually\noutcompete humans by facilitating human learning about the behaviour of each\npartner type. These findings show how AI can reshape social interaction in\nmixed societies and inform the design of more effective and cooperative hybrid\nsystems.",

By introducing advanced context-aware\ntoken management and supporting concurrent multi-query processing, the proposed\narchitecture handles interdependent tasks typical of modern urban mobility\nenvironments.

Second, it is\nunclear to what extent the probed values capture in-context information and\nreflect models' preferences for real-world actions. In this paper, we evaluate\nthe robustness and expressiveness of value representations across three widely\nused probing strategies. We use variations in prompts and options, showing that\nall methods exhibit large variances under input perturbations. We also\nintroduce two tasks studying whether the values are responsive to demographic\ncontext, and how well they align with the models' behaviors in value-related\nscenarios. We show that the demographic context has little effect on the\nfree-text generation, and the models' values only weakly correlate with their\npreference for value-based actions.

Our approach leverages the prior knowledge of large\nlanguage model (LLM) to address the scarcity of labeled data, with the LLM\nfunctioning as a data engineer by extracting informative features to enable\neffective estimation in few-shot settings. Specifically, our model obtains\ncontextual relationships between data features and the target indicator,\ncategorizing their correlations as positive, negative, mixed, or irrelevant.\nThese features are then fed into the linear estimator with tailored weight\nconstraints for each category. To capture nonlinear patterns, the model also\nidentifies meaningful feature interactions and integrates them, along with\nnonlinear transformations. Experiments across three countries at different\nstages of development demonstrate that our model outperforms baselines in\nestimating socio-economic indicators, even for low-income countries with\nlimited data availability.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) leverage deep learning to process and predict\nsequences of words from context, enabling them to perform various NLP tasks,\nsuch as translation, summarization, question answering, and content generation.\nHowever, the growing size and complexity of developing, training, and deploying\nadvanced LLMs require extensive computational resources and large datasets.\nThis creates a barrier for users. As a result, platforms that host models and\ndatasets are widely used. For example, Hugging Face, one of the most popular\nplatforms, hosted 1.8 million models and 450K datasets by June 2025, with no\nsign of slowing down. Since many LLMs are built from base models, pre-trained\nmodels, and external datasets, they can inherit vulnerabilities, biases, or\nmalicious components from earlier models or datasets. Therefore, it is critical\nto understand the origin and development of these components to better detect\npotential risks, improve model fairness, and ensure compliance. Motivated by\nthis, our project aims to study the relationships between models and datasets,\nwhich are core components of the LLM supply chain. First, we design a method to\nsystematically collect LLM supply chain data. Using this data, we build a\ndirected heterogeneous graph to model the relationships between models and\ndatasets, resulting in a structure with 397,376 nodes and 453,469 edges. We\nthen perform various analyses and uncover several findings, such as: (i) the\nLLM supply chain graph is large, sparse, and follows a power-law degree\ndistribution; (ii) it features a densely connected core and a fragmented\nperiphery; (iii) datasets play pivotal roles in training; (iv) strong\ninterdependence exists between models and datasets; and (v) the graph is\ndynamic, with daily updates reflecting the ecosystem's ongoing evolution.",

The lab consists of two\ntasks: Task A - Multilingual Job Title Matching, covering English, Spanish,\nGerman, and Chinese; and Task B - Job Title-Based Skill Prediction, in English.\nBoth corpora were built from real job applications, carefully anonymized, and\nmanually annotated to reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world labor\nmarket data, including linguistic variability and gender-marked expressions.\n  The evaluations included monolingual and cross-lingual scenarios and covered\nthe evaluation of gender bias.\n  TalentCLEF attracted 76 registered teams with more than 280 submissions. Most\nsystems relied on information retrieval techniques built with multilingual\nencoder-based models fine-tuned with contrastive learning, and several of them\nincorporated large language models for data augmentation or re-ranking.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive abilities in leveraging\npretrained knowledge through prompting, but they often struggle with unseen\ntasks, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. While cross-task in-context\nlearning offers a direct solution for transferring knowledge across tasks, it\nstill faces critical challenges in terms of robustness, scalability, and\nefficiency. In this paper, we investigate whether cross-task transfer can be\nachieved via latent space steering without parameter updates or input\nexpansion. Through an analysis of activation patterns in the latent space of\nLLMs, we observe that the enhanced activations induced by in-context examples\nhave consistent patterns across different tasks. Inspired by these findings, we\npropose CAST, a novel Cross-task Activation Steering Transfer framework that\nenables effective transfer by manipulating the model's internal activation\nstates. Our approach first selects influential and diverse samples from\nhigh-resource tasks, then utilizes their contrastive representation-enhanced\nactivations to adapt LLMs to low-resource tasks. Extensive experiments across\nboth cross-domain and cross-lingual transfer settings show that our method\noutperforms competitive baselines and demonstrates superior scalability and\nlower computational costs.",

    "summary": "The advancement of powerful yet opaque large language models (LLMs)\nnecessitates a fundamental revision of the philosophical criteria used to\nevaluate artificial moral agents (AMAs). Pre-LLM frameworks often relied on the\nassumption of transparent architectures, which LLMs defy due to their\nstochastic outputs and opaque internal states. This paper argues that\ntraditional ethical criteria are pragmatically obsolete for LLMs due to this\nmismatch. Engaging with core themes in the philosophy of technology, this paper\nproffers a revised set of ten functional criteria to evaluate LLM-based\nartificial moral agents: moral concordance, context sensitivity, normative\nintegrity, metaethical awareness, system resilience, trustworthiness,\ncorrigibility, partial transparency, functional autonomy, and moral\nimagination. These guideposts, applied to what we term \"SMA-LLS\" (Simulating\nMoral Agency through Large Language Systems), aim to steer AMAs toward greater\nalignment and beneficial societal integration in the coming years. We\nillustrate these criteria using hypothetical scenarios involving an autonomous\npublic bus (APB) to demonstrate their practical applicability in morally\nsalient contexts.",

To address this\nchallenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation\ndriven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open\ninterface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling\nexplicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs\na two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven\nby a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into\noptimal RDA configurations.

However, the extensive use of LLM-generated code also raises\nseveral new challenges.

How to effectively detect LLM-generated code and ensure its\ncompliant and responsible use has become a critical and urgent issue. On the\nother hand, in practical applications, LLM-generated code is often subject to\nmanual modifications, such as variable renaming or structural adjustments.\nAlthough some recent studies have proposed training-based and zero-shot methods\nfor detecting LLM-generated code, these approaches show insufficient robustness\nwhen facing modified LLM-generated code, and there is a lack of an effective\nsolution. To address the real-world scenario where LLM-generated code may\nundergo minor modifications, we propose CodeGPTSensor+, an enhanced version of\nCodeGPTSensor, which employs adversarial training to improve robustness against\ninput perturbations. CodeGPTSensor+ integrates an adversarial sample generation\nmodule, Multi-objective Identifier and Structure Transformation (MIST), which\nsystematically generates both high-quality and representative adversarial\nsamples.

However, little is\nknown about how LLMs use this information in their decision-making in\nreal-world applications. We perform the first comprehensive analysis of how\nidentity markers present in a user's writing bias LLM responses across five\ndifferent high-stakes LLM applications in the domains of medicine, law,\npolitics, government benefits, and job salaries. We find that LLMs are\nextremely sensitive to markers of identity in user queries and that race,\ngender, and age consistently influence LLM responses in these applications. For\ninstance, when providing medical advice, we find that models apply different\nstandards of care to individuals of different ethnicities for the same\nsymptoms; we find that LLMs are more likely to alter answers to align with a\nconservative (liberal) political worldview when asked factual questions by\nolder (younger) individuals; and that LLMs recommend lower salaries for\nnon-White job applicants and higher salaries for women compared to men. Taken\ntogether, these biases mean that the use of off-the-shelf LLMs for these\napplications may cause harmful differences in medical care, foster wage gaps,\nand create different political factual realities for people of different\nidentities. Beyond providing an analysis, we also provide new tools for\nevaluating how subtle encoding of identity in users' language choices impacts\nmodel decisions. Given the serious implications of these findings, we recommend\nthat similar thorough assessments of LLM use in user-facing applications are\nconducted before future deployment.",

    "summary": "Recent Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) advancements are promising, but\ntheir idealized assumptions about robot movement and control fail to reflect\nphysically embodied deployment challenges. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nVLN-PE, a physically realistic VLN platform supporting humanoid, quadruped, and\nwheeled robots. For the first time, we systematically evaluate several\nego-centric VLN methods in physical robotic settings across different technical\npipelines, including classification models for single-step discrete action\nprediction, a diffusion model for dense waypoint prediction, and a train-free,\nmap-based large language model (LLM) integrated with path planning. Our results\nreveal significant performance degradation due to limited robot observation\nspace, environmental lighting variations, and physical challenges like\ncollisions and falls. This also exposes locomotion constraints for legged\nrobots in complex environments. VLN-PE is highly extensible, allowing seamless\nintegration of new scenes beyond MP3D, thereby enabling more comprehensive VLN\nevaluation. Despite the weak generalization of current models in physical\ndeployment, VLN-PE provides a new pathway for improving cross-embodiment's\noverall adaptability. We hope our findings and tools inspire the community to\nrethink VLN limitations and advance robust, practical VLN models.

However,\ninterrelationship among input modalities, uncertainties due to individual\nuni-modal data and potential clinical applications following such an\nuncertainty decomposition are yet fully understood in the context of\nlarge-scale MLLMs. In this work, we propose a multimodal uncertainty\npropagation model (MUPM) based on uncertainty propagation, to characterise the\nrelationship among the uncertainties arising from image-only, text-only, and\njoint image-text variations in MLLM inputs. Using real clinical data consisting\nof cardiac MR scans and digital health records, we describe that MUPMs can be\noptimised robustly with a few samples. We then show that the fitted MUPMs are\ngeneralisable across different input data distributions and, perhaps\nsurprisingly, across different downstream tasks. Such a transferability may be\nexplained by the shared pretraining, comparatively light MLLM fine-tuning,\nalong with the low-dimensional nature of the MUPMs. More importantly, this\nlearned transferability, quantifying the relationship between these\nuncertainties, led to direct clinical applications in which uncertainties may\nbe estimated and thus analysed robustly for varying data or even a novel set of\ncardiac disease prediction tasks. In addition, we show experimentally the\nefficiency in multimodal data required for estimating the overall uncertainty\nand its ability to identify redundant factors, both of which are considered\npractical yet clinically useful applications with the proposed MUPMs. Codes are\navailable at https://github.com/yucheng722/MUPM.",

    "summary": "Advancements in foundation models have made it possible to conduct\napplications in various downstream tasks. Especially, the new era has witnessed\na remarkable capability to extend Large Language Models (LLMs) for tackling\ntasks of 3D scene understanding. Current methods rely heavily on 3D point\nclouds, but the 3D point cloud reconstruction of an indoor scene often results\nin information loss. Some textureless planes or repetitive patterns are prone\nto omission and manifest as voids within the reconstructed 3D point clouds.\nBesides, objects with complex structures tend to introduce distortion of\ndetails caused by misalignments between the captured images and the dense\nreconstructed point clouds. 2D multi-view images present visual consistency\nwith 3D point clouds and provide more detailed representations of scene\ncomponents, which can naturally compensate for these deficiencies. Based on\nthese insights, we propose Argus, a novel 3D multimodal framework that\nleverages multi-view images for enhanced 3D scene understanding with LLMs. In\ngeneral, Argus can be treated as a 3D Large Multimodal Foundation Model\n(3D-LMM) since it takes various modalities as input(text instructions, 2D\nmulti-view images, and 3D point clouds) and expands the capability of LLMs to\ntackle 3D tasks. Argus involves fusing and integrating multi-view images and\ncamera poses into view-as-scene features, which interact with the 3D features\nto create comprehensive and detailed 3D-aware scene embeddings. Our approach\ncompensates for the information loss while reconstructing 3D point clouds and\nhelps LLMs better understand the 3D world.

    "summary": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) with control systems has\ndemonstrated significant potential in various settings, such as task completion\nwith a robotic manipulator. A main reason for this success is the ability of\nLLMs to perform in-context learning, which, however, strongly relies on the\ndesign of task examples, closely related to the target tasks. Consequently,\nemploying LLMs to formulate optimal control problems often requires task\nexamples that contain explicit mathematical expressions, designed by trained\nengineers. Furthermore, there is often no principled way to evaluate for\nhallucination before task execution. To address these challenges, we propose\nDEMONSTRATE, a novel methodology that avoids the use of LLMs for complex\noptimization problem generations, and instead only relies on the embedding\nrepresentations of task descriptions. To do this, we leverage tools from\ninverse optimal control to replace in-context prompt examples with task\ndemonstrations, as well as the concept of multitask learning, which ensures\ntarget and example task similarity by construction. Given the fact that\nhardware demonstrations can easily be collected using teleoperation or guidance\nof the robot, our approach significantly reduces the reliance on engineering\nexpertise for designing in-context examples. Furthermore, the enforced\nmultitask structure enables learning from few demonstrations and assessment of\nhallucinations prior to task execution.

As a result, simply classifying workloads as latency-sensitive\n(LS) or best-effort (BE) overlooks the nuances within the latency-sensitive\ncategory and results in suboptimal user experiences and scheduling\nopportunities. However, efficiently serving requests with multiple SLO\nrequirements poses significant challenges. First, all requests within a batch\ngenerate new tokens simultaneously, which can misalign them with their distinct\nSLO requirements. Moreover, while existing systems focus on auto-scaling for\nhandling various overall request rates, the diversity of SLOs necessitates\nfine-grained auto-scaling among these SLO tiers. Finally, unlike LS/BE\nscenarios, where BE requests can be aborted at any time to ensure the SLO\nattainment of LS requests, those with different latency-sensitive SLOs cannot\ntolerate prolonged delays, and tail latency must be controlled.\n  To tackle these challenges, we propose PolyServe, a novel multi-SLO\nscheduling policy at scale that maintains high SLO attainment while maximizing\nthroughput. PolyServe first groups requests into multiple bins based on their\nper-token latency requirement, then schedules each bin to a subset of the\nserver fleet. PolyServe routes requests to the highest-load but still\nSLO-attainable server to create a load gradient that facilitates auto-scaling.\nTo increase utilization, PolyServe permits looser-SLO requests to share\ntighter-SLO instances when their own servers are saturated. PolyServe uses\nprofiling data to guide scheduling decisions and manage tail latency through\nrequest-wait-time-aware scheduling, dynamic chunking, and continuous chunked\nprefill prediction. PolyServe achieves 1.23x goodput gain compared to existing\npolicies, achieving up to 92.5% of optimal goodput.",

    "summary": "Document quality assessment is critical for a wide range of applications\nincluding document digitization, OCR, and archival. However, existing\napproaches often struggle to provide accurate and robust quality scores,\nlimiting their applicability in practical scenarios. With the rapid progress in\nMulti-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), recent MLLM-based methods have\nachieved remarkable performance in image quality assessment. In this work, we\nextend this success to the document domain by adapting DeQA-Score, a\nstate-of-the-art MLLM-based image quality scorer, for document quality\nassessment. We propose DeQA-Doc, a framework that leverages the visual language\ncapabilities of MLLMs and a soft label strategy to regress continuous document\nquality scores. To adapt DeQA-Score to DeQA-Doc, we adopt two complementary\nsolutions to construct soft labels without the variance information. Also, we\nrelax the resolution constrains to support the large resolution of document\nimages. Finally, we introduce ensemble methods to further enhance the\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeQA-Doc significantly\noutperforms existing baselines, offering accurate and generalizable document\nquality assessment across diverse degradation types.

However, critical\noverdose data are often buried in free-text coroner reports, leading to delays\nand information loss when coded into ICD (International Classification of\nDisease)-10 classifications. Natural language processing (NLP) models may\nautomate and enhance overdose surveillance, but prior applications have been\nlimited. A dataset of 35,433 death records from multiple U.S. jurisdictions in\n2020 was used for model training and internal testing. External validation was\nconducted using a novel separate dataset of 3,335 records from 2023-2024.\nMultiple NLP approaches were evaluated for classifying specific drug\ninvolvement from unstructured death certificate text. These included\ntraditional single- and multi-label classifiers, as well as fine-tuned\nencoder-only language models such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) and BioClinicalBERT, and contemporary decoder-only large\nlanguage models such as Qwen 3 and Llama 3. Model performance was assessed\nusing macro-averaged F1 scores, and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to\nquantify uncertainty. Fine-tuned BioClinicalBERT models achieved near-perfect\nperformance, with macro F1 scores >=0.998 on the internal test set. External\nvalidation confirmed robustness (macro F1=0.966), outperforming conventional\nmachine learning, general-domain BERT models, and various decoder-only large\nlanguage models. NLP models, particularly fine-tuned clinical variants like\nBioClinicalBERT, offer a highly accurate and scalable solution for overdose\ndeath classification from free-text reports. These methods can significantly\naccelerate surveillance workflows, overcoming the limitations of manual ICD-10\ncoding and supporting near real-time detection of emerging substance use\ntrends.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a cornerstone of modern AI, driving\nbreakthroughs in natural language processing and expanding into multimodal jobs\ninvolving images, audio, and video. As with most computational software, it is\nimportant to distinguish between ordinary runtime performance and startup\noverhead. Prior research has focused on runtime performance: improving training\nefficiency and stability. This work focuses instead on the increasingly\ncritical issue of startup overhead in training: the delay before training jobs\nbegin execution. Startup overhead is particularly important in large,\nindustrial-scale LLMs, where failures occur more frequently and multiple teams\noperate in iterative update-debug cycles. In one of our training clusters, more\nthan 3.5% of GPU time is wasted due to startup overhead alone.\n  In this work, we present the first in-depth characterization of LLM training\nstartup overhead based on real production data. We analyze the components of\nstartup cost, quantify its direct impact, and examine how it scales with job\nsize. These insights motivate the design of Bootseer, a system-level\noptimization framework that addresses three primary startup bottlenecks: (a)\ncontainer image loading, (b) runtime dependency installation, and (c) model\ncheckpoint resumption. To mitigate these bottlenecks, Bootseer introduces three\ntechniques: (a) hot block record-and-prefetch, (b) dependency snapshotting, and\n(c) striped HDFS-FUSE. Bootseer has been deployed in a production environment\nand evaluated on real LLM training workloads, demonstrating a 50% reduction in\nstartup overhead.",

    "summary": "The performance of finetuned large language models (LLMs) hinges critically\non the composition of the training mixture. However, selecting an optimal blend\nof task datasets remains a largely manual, heuristic driven process, with\npractitioners often relying on uniform or size based sampling strategies. We\nintroduce TASKPGM, a principled and scalable framework for mixture optimization\nthat selects continuous task proportions by minimizing an energy function over\na Markov Random Field (MRF). Task relationships are modeled using behavioral\ndivergences such as Jensen Shannon Divergence and Pointwise Mutual Information\ncomputed from the predictive distributions of single task finetuned models. Our\nmethod yields a closed form solution under simplex constraints and provably\nbalances representativeness and diversity among tasks. We provide theoretical\nguarantees, including weak submodularity for budgeted variants, and demonstrate\nconsistent empirical improvements on Llama 2 and Mistral across evaluation\nsuites such as MMLU and BIGBench. Beyond performance, TASKPGM offers\ninterpretable insights into task influence and mixture composition, making it a\npowerful tool for efficient and robust LLM finetuning.",

    "summary": "Organizations increasingly rely on proprietary enterprise data, including HR\nrecords, structured reports, and tabular documents, for critical\ndecision-making. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have strong generative\ncapabilities, they are limited by static pretraining, short context windows,\nand challenges in processing heterogeneous data formats. Conventional\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks address some of these gaps but\noften struggle with structured and semi-structured data.\n  This work proposes an advanced RAG framework that combines hybrid retrieval\nstrategies using dense embeddings (all-mpnet-base-v2) and BM25, enhanced by\nmetadata-aware filtering with SpaCy NER and cross-encoder reranking. The\nframework applies semantic chunking to maintain textual coherence and retains\ntabular data structures to preserve row-column integrity. Quantized indexing\noptimizes retrieval efficiency, while human-in-the-loop feedback and\nconversation memory improve adaptability.\n  Experiments on enterprise datasets show notable improvements: Precision@5\nincreased by 15 percent (90 versus 75), Recall@5 by 13 percent (87 versus 74),\nand Mean Reciprocal Rank by 16 percent (0.85 versus 0.69). Qualitative\nevaluations show higher scores in Faithfulness (4.6 versus 3.0), Completeness\n(4.2 versus 2.5), and Relevance (4.5 versus 3.2) on a 5-point Likert scale.\nThese results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in delivering accurate,\ncomprehensive, and contextually relevant responses for enterprise tasks. Future\nwork includes extending to multimodal data and integrating agent-based\nretrieval. The source code will be released at\nhttps://github.com/CheerlaChandana/Enterprise-Chatbot",

Using a synthetic\ndataset of 48 X (Twitter) accounts and a survey dataset of 1,384 international\nparticipants, we show that these models can access social media content and\npredict user demographics with reasonable accuracy. Analysis of the synthetic\ndataset further reveals how LLMs parse and interpret social media profiles,\nwhich may introduce gender and political biases against accounts with minimal\nactivity. While this capability holds promise for computational social science\nin the post API era, it also raises risks of misuse particularly in information\noperations and targeted advertising underscoring the need for safeguards.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become widely used across diverse NLP tasks\nand domains, demonstrating their adaptability and effectiveness. In the realm\nof Electronic Design Automation (EDA), LLMs show promise for tasks like\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation and summarization. However,\ndespite the proliferation of LLMs for general code-related tasks, there's a\ndearth of research focused on evaluating and refining these models for hardware\ndescription languages (HDLs), notably VHDL. In this study, we evaluate the\nperformance of existing code LLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization\nusing various metrics and two datasets -- VHDL-Eval and VHDL-Xform. The latter,\nan in-house dataset, aims to gauge LLMs' understanding of functionally\nequivalent code. Our findings reveal consistent underperformance of these\nmodels across different metrics, underscoring a significant gap in their\nsuitability for this domain. To address this challenge, we propose\nChain-of-Descriptions (CoDes), a novel approach to enhance the performance of\nLLMs for VHDL code generation and summarization tasks. CoDes involves\ngenerating a series of intermediate descriptive steps based on: (i) the problem\nstatement for code generation, and (ii) the VHDL code for summarization. These\nsteps are then integrated with the original input prompt (problem statement or\ncode) and provided as input to the LLMs to generate the final output. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the CoDes approach significantly surpasses the\nstandard prompting strategy across various metrics on both datasets. This\nmethod not only improves the quality of VHDL code generation and summarization\nbut also serves as a framework for future research aimed at enhancing code LLMs\nfor VHDL.",

    "summary": "Generative AI does not only replicate human creativity but also reproduces\ndeep-seated cultural biases, making it crucial to critically examine how\nconcepts like ugliness are understood and expressed by these tools. This study\ninvestigates how four different generative AI models understand and express\nugliness through text and image and explores the biases embedded within these\nrepresentations. We extracted 13 adjectives associated with ugliness through\niterative prompting of a large language model and generated 624 images across\nfour AI models and three prompts. Demographic and socioeconomic attributes\nwithin the images were independently coded and thematically analyzed. Our\nfindings show that AI models disproportionately associate ugliness with old\nwhite male figures, reflecting entrenched social biases as well as paradoxical\nbiases, where efforts to avoid stereotypical depictions of marginalized groups\ninadvertently result in the disproportionate projection of negative attributes\nonto majority groups. Qualitative analysis further reveals that, despite\nsupposed attempts to frame ugliness within social contexts, conventional\nphysical markers such as asymmetry and aging persist as central visual motifs.\nThese findings demonstrate that despite attempts to create more equal\nrepresentations, generative AI continues to perpetuate inherited and\nparadoxical biases, underscoring the critical work being done to create ethical\nAI training paradigms and advance methodologies for more inclusive AI\ndevelopment.",

However, such summaries must not only be accurate and\nconcise but also equitably represent the views and contributions of all\nspeakers. This paper explores the use of LLMs to summarise plenary debates from\nthe European Parliament and investigates the algorithmic and representational\nbiases that emerge in this context. We propose a structured, multi-stage\nsummarisation framework that improves textual coherence and content fidelity,\nwhile enabling the systematic analysis of how speaker attributes -- such as\nspeaking order or political affiliation -- influence the visibility and\naccuracy of their contributions in the final summaries. Through our experiments\nusing both proprietary and open-weight LLMs, we find evidence of consistent\npositional and partisan biases, with certain speakers systematically\nunder-represented or misattributed. Our analysis shows that these biases vary\nby model and summarisation strategy, with hierarchical approaches offering the\ngreatest potential to reduce disparity. These findings underscore the need for\ndomain-sensitive evaluation metrics and ethical oversight in the deployment of\nLLMs for democratic applications.",

In this way, DSSD replaces the\nuplink transmission of multiple vocabulary distributions with a single downlink\ntransmission, significantly reducing communication latency while maintaining\ninference quality. Experiments show that our solution outperforms current\nmethods, and codes are at:\nhttps://github.com/JasonNing96/DSSD-Efficient-Edge-Computing",

    "title": "Can LLMs Find Fraudsters? Multi-level LLM Enhanced Graph Fraud Detection",
    "summary": "Graph fraud detection has garnered significant attention as Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) have proven effective in modeling complex relationships within\nmultimodal data. However, existing graph fraud detection methods typically use\npreprocessed node embeddings and predefined graph structures to reveal\nfraudsters, which ignore the rich semantic cues contained in raw textual\ninformation. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit powerful\ncapabilities in processing textual information, it remains a significant\nchallenge to perform multimodal fusion of processed textual embeddings with\ngraph structures. In this paper, we propose a \\textbf{M}ulti-level \\textbf{L}LM\n\\textbf{E}nhanced Graph Fraud \\textbf{D}etection framework called MLED. In\nMLED, we utilize LLMs to extract external knowledge from textual information to\nenhance graph fraud detection methods. To integrate LLMs with graph structure\ninformation and enhance the ability to distinguish fraudsters, we design a\nmulti-level LLM enhanced framework including type-level enhancer and\nrelation-level enhancer. One is to enhance the difference between the\nfraudsters and the benign entities, the other is to enhance the importance of\nthe fraudsters in different relations. The experiments on four real-world\ndatasets show that MLED achieves state-of-the-art performance in graph fraud\ndetection as a generalized framework that can be applied to existing methods.",

In human\nsocieties, value similarity is important for building trust and close\nrelationships; however, it remains unexplored whether this principle holds true\nin artificial societies comprising LLM agents. Therefore, this study\ninvestigates the influence of value similarity on relationship-building among\nLLM agents through two experiments. First, in a preliminary experiment, we\nevaluated the controllability of values in LLMs to identify the most effective\nmodel and prompt design for controlling the values. Subsequently, in the main\nexperiment, we generated pairs of LLM agents imbued with specific values and\nanalyzed their mutual evaluations of trust and interpersonal closeness\nfollowing a dialogue. The experiments were conducted in English and Japanese to\ninvestigate language dependence. The results confirmed that pairs of agents\nwith higher value similarity exhibited greater mutual trust and interpersonal\ncloseness. Our findings demonstrate that the LLM agent simulation serves as a\nvalid testbed for social science theories, contributes to elucidating the\nmechanisms by which values influence relationship building, and provides a\nfoundation for inspiring new theories and insights into the social sciences.",

However, their deployment is\nchallenging due to the substantial computational resources required.\nPower-of-two (PoT) quantization is a general tool to counteract this\ndifficulty. Albeit previous works on PoT quantization can be efficiently\ndequantized on CPUs using fixed-point addition, it showed less effectiveness on\nGPUs. The reason is entanglement of the sign bit and sequential bit\nmanipulations needed for dequantization. We propose a novel POT quantization\nframework for LLM weights that (i) outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy in\nextremely low-precision number formats, and (ii) enables faster inference\nthrough more efficient dequantization. To maintain the accuracy of the\nquantized model, we introduce a two-step post-training algorithm: (i)\ninitialize the quantization scales with a robust starting point, and (ii)\nrefine these scales using a minimal calibration set. The performance of our PoT\npost-training algorithm surpasses the current state-of-the-art in integer\nquantization, particularly at low precisions such as 2- and 3-bit formats. Our\nPoT quantization accelerates the dequantization step required for the floating\npoint inference and leads to $3.67\\times$ speed up on a NVIDIA V100, and\n$1.63\\times$ on a NVIDIA RTX 4090, compared to uniform integer dequantization.",

Recent advances in\nlarge-scale models have led to benchmark solutions such as GraspNet-1Billion.\nHowever, such learning-based approaches still face a critical limitation in\nperformance robustness for their sensitivity to sensing noise and environmental\nchanges. To address this bottleneck in achieving highly generalized grasping,\nwe abandon the traditional learning framework and introduce a new perspective:\nsimilarity matching, where similar known objects are utilized to guide the\ngrasping of unknown target objects. We newly propose a method that robustly\nachieves unknown-object grasping from a single viewpoint through three key\nsteps: 1) Leverage the visual features of the observed object to perform\nsimilarity matching with an existing database containing various object models,\nidentifying potential candidates with high similarity; 2) Use the candidate\nmodels with pre-existing grasping knowledge to plan imitative grasps for the\nunknown target object; 3) Optimize the grasp quality through a local\nfine-tuning process. To address the uncertainty caused by partial and noisy\nobservation, we propose a multi-level similarity matching framework that\nintegrates semantic, geometric, and dimensional features for comprehensive\nevaluation. Especially, we introduce a novel point cloud geometric descriptor,\nthe C-FPFH descriptor, which facilitates accurate similarity assessment between\npartial point clouds of observed objects and complete point clouds of database\nmodels. In addition, we incorporate the use of large language models, introduce\nthe semi-oriented bounding box, and develop a novel point cloud registration\napproach based on plane detection to enhance matching accuracy under\nsingle-view conditions.

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) evolve in complexity and capability, the\nefficacy of less widely deployed alignment techniques are uncertain. Building\non previous work on activation steering and contrastive activation addition\n(CAA), this paper explores the effectiveness of CAA with model scale using the\nfamily of Llama 2 models (7B, 13B, and 70B). CAA works by finding desirable\n'directions' in the model's residual stream vector space using contrastive\npairs (for example, hate to love) and adding this direction to the residual\nstream during the forward pass. It directly manipulates the residual stream and\naims to extract features from language models to better control their outputs.\nUsing answer matching questions centered around the refusal behavior, we found\nthat 1) CAA is most effective when applied at early-mid layers. 2) The\neffectiveness of CAA diminishes with model size. 3) Negative steering has more\npronounced effects than positive steering across all model sizes.",

    "summary": "Recognizing the information flows and operations comprising data science and\nmachine learning Python notebooks is critical for evaluating, reusing, and\nadapting notebooks for new tasks. Investigating a notebook via re-execution\noften is impractical due to the challenges of resolving data and software\ndependencies. While Large Language Models (LLMs) pre-trained on large codebases\nhave demonstrated effectiveness in understanding code without running it, we\nobserve that they fail to understand some realistic notebooks due to\nhallucinations and long-context challenges. To address these issues, we propose\na notebook understanding task yielding an information flow graph and\ncorresponding cell execution dependency graph for a notebook, and demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a pincer strategy that uses limited syntactic analysis to\nassist full comprehension of the notebook using an LLM. Our Capture and Resolve\nAssisted Bounding Strategy (CRABS) employs shallow syntactic parsing and\nanalysis of the abstract syntax tree (AST) to capture the correct\ninterpretation of a notebook between lower and upper estimates of the\ninter-cell I/O sets, then uses an LLM to resolve remaining ambiguities via\ncell-by-cell zero-shot learning, thereby identifying the true data inputs and\noutputs of each cell. We evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach using an annotated dataset of 50 representative, highly up-voted\nKaggle notebooks that together represent 3454 actual cell inputs and outputs.\nThe LLM correctly resolves 1397 of 1425 (98%) ambiguities left by analyzing the\nsyntactic structure of these notebooks.

    "summary": "Operating Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is increasingly\nchallenged by limited communication bandwidth and strained computational and\nmemory costs. Thus, cloud-assisted remote fine-tuning becomes indispensable.\nNevertheless, existing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) approaches typically employ\nfixed or heuristic rank configurations, and the subsequent over-the-air\ntransmission of all LoRA parameters could be rather inefficient. To address\nthis limitation, we develop AirLLM, a hierarchical diffusion policy framework\nfor communication-aware LoRA adaptation. Specifically, AirLLM models the rank\nconfiguration as a structured action vector that spans all LoRA-inserted\nprojections. To solve the underlying high-dimensional sequential\ndecision-making problem, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent generates\ncoarse-grained decisions by jointly observing wireless states and linguistic\ncomplexity, which are then refined via Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) to produce high-resolution, task- and channel-adaptive rank vectors. The\ntwo modules are optimized alternatively, with the DDIM trained under the\nClassifier-Free Guidance (CFG) paradigm to maintain alignment with PPO rewards.\nExperiments under varying signal-to-noise ratios demonstrate that AirLLM\nconsistently enhances fine-tuning performance while significantly reducing\ntransmission costs, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforcement-driven,\ndiffusion-refined rank adaptation for scalable and efficient remote fine-tuning\nover the air.",

    "summary": "Accurate preoperative assessment of lymph node (LN) metastasis in rectal\ncancer guides treatment decisions, yet conventional MRI evaluation based on\nmorphological criteria shows limited diagnostic performance. While some\nartificial intelligence models have been developed, they often operate as black\nboxes, lacking the interpretability needed for clinical trust. Moreover, these\nmodels typically evaluate nodes in isolation, overlooking the patient-level\ncontext. To address these limitations, we introduce LRMR, an LLM-Driven\nRelational Multi-node Ranking framework. This approach reframes the diagnostic\ntask from a direct classification problem into a structured reasoning and\nranking process. The LRMR framework operates in two stages. First, a multimodal\nlarge language model (LLM) analyzes a composite montage image of all LNs from a\npatient, generating a structured report that details ten distinct radiological\nfeatures. Second, a text-based LLM performs pairwise comparisons of these\nreports between different patients, establishing a relative risk ranking based\non the severity and number of adverse features. We evaluated our method on a\nretrospective cohort of 117 rectal cancer patients. LRMR achieved an area under\nthe curve (AUC) of 0.7917 and an F1-score of 0.7200, outperforming a range of\ndeep learning baselines, including ResNet50 (AUC 0.7708). Ablation studies\nconfirmed the value of our two main contributions: removing the relational\nranking stage or the structured prompting stage led to a significant\nperformance drop, with AUCs falling to 0.6875 and 0.6458, respectively. Our\nwork demonstrates that decoupling visual perception from cognitive reasoning\nthrough a two-stage LLM framework offers a powerful, interpretable, and\neffective new paradigm for assessing lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer.",

    "title": "From Chaos to Automation: Enabling the Use of Unstructured Data for\n  Robotic Process Automation",
    "summary": "The growing volume of unstructured data within organizations poses\nsignificant challenges for data analysis and process automation. Unstructured\ndata, which lacks a predefined format, encompasses various forms such as\nemails, reports, and scans. It is estimated to constitute approximately 80% of\nenterprise data. Despite the valuable insights it can offer, extracting\nmeaningful information from unstructured data is more complex compared to\nstructured data. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has gained popularity for\nautomating repetitive tasks, improving efficiency, and reducing errors.\nHowever, RPA is traditionally reliant on structured data, limiting its\napplication to processes involving unstructured documents. This study addresses\nthis limitation by developing the UNstructured Document REtrieval SyStem\n(UNDRESS), a system that uses fuzzy regular expressions, techniques for natural\nlanguage processing, and large language models to enable RPA platforms to\neffectively retrieve information from unstructured documents. The research\ninvolved the design and development of a prototype system, and its subsequent\nevaluation based on text extraction and information retrieval performance. The\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of UNDRESS in enhancing RPA capabilities\nfor unstructured data, providing a significant advancement in the field. The\nfindings suggest that this system could facilitate broader RPA adoption across\nprocesses traditionally hindered by unstructured data, thereby improving\noverall business process efficiency.",

The large\nlanguage model (LLM) possesses a wealth of knowledge, while human experts\npossess judgment abilities that the LLM does not possess. Therefore, our\nresearch integrates the knowledge and abilities of LLM and human experts to\naddress the limitations of novelty assessment. One of the most common types of\nnovelty in academic papers is the introduction of new methods. In this paper,\nwe propose leveraging human knowledge and LLM to assist pretrained language\nmodels (PLMs, e.g. BERT etc.) in predicting the method novelty of papers.\nSpecifically, we extract sentences related to the novelty of the academic paper\nfrom peer review reports and use LLM to summarize the methodology section of\nthe academic paper, which are then used to fine-tune PLMs. In addition, we have\ndesigned a text-guided fusion module with novel Sparse-Attention to better\nintegrate human and LLM knowledge.

    "title": "Role-Playing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Support Framework for Detecting and\n  Addressing Family Communication Bias",
    "summary": "Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that\nconventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental\nexpectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional\nexpression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,\noften stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is\ndifficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these\nlatent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support\nfor psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese\nparent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on\nideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a\nRole-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes\ndialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,\ndescribe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual\nattributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these\noutputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert\nagents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable\nfeedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show\nthat the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate\naccuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.\nMoreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited\nsigns of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the\nframework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family\ninteractions.",

While multi-agent\nsystems (MAS) can emulate human coding workflows, their benefits over\nsingle-agent coding remain poorly understood. We conducted an experimental\nstudy of how agent persona and temperature shape consensus-building and coding\naccuracy of dialog segments based on a codebook with 8 codes. Our open-source\nMAS mirrors deductive human coding through structured agent discussion and\nconsensus arbitration. Using six open-source LLMs (with 3 to 32 billion\nparameters) and 18 experimental configurations, we analyze over 77,000 coding\ndecisions against a gold-standard dataset of human-annotated transcripts from\nonline math tutoring sessions. Temperature significantly impacted whether and\nwhen consensus was reached across all six LLMs. MAS with multiple personas\n(including neutral, assertive, or empathetic), significantly delayed consensus\nin four out of six LLMs compared to uniform personas. In three of those LLMs,\nhigher temperatures significantly diminished the effects of multiple personas\non consensus. However, neither temperature nor persona pairing lead to robust\nimprovements in coding accuracy. Single agents matched or outperformed MAS\nconsensus in most conditions. Only one model (OpenHermesV2:7B) and code\ncategory showed above-chance gains from MAS deliberation when temperature was\n0.5 or lower and especially when the agents included at least one assertive\npersona. Qualitative analysis of MAS collaboration for these configurations\nsuggests that MAS may nonetheless aid in narrowing ambiguous code applications\nthat could improve codebooks and human-AI coding.

However, most existing works\nassume a phrase and focus on the attack's effectiveness, offering limited\nunderstanding of trigger mechanisms and how multiple triggers interact within\nthe model. In this paper, we present a framework for studying poisoning in\nLLMs. We show that multiple distinct backdoor triggers can coexist within a\nsingle model without interfering with each other, enabling adversaries to embed\nseveral triggers concurrently. Using multiple triggers with high embedding\nsimilarity, we demonstrate that poisoned triggers can achieve robust activation\neven when tokens are substituted or separated by long token spans. Our findings\nexpose a broader and more persistent vulnerability surface in LLMs. To mitigate\nthis threat, we propose a post hoc recovery method that selectively retrains\nspecific model components based on a layer-wise weight difference analysis.

    "summary": "Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a\npowerful alternative to autoregressive LLMs, offering faster inference and\ngreater interactivity via parallel decoding and bidirectional modeling.\nHowever, despite strong performance in code generation and text infilling, we\nidentify a fundamental safety concern: existing alignment mechanisms fail to\nsafeguard dLLMs against context-aware, masked-input adversarial prompts,\nexposing novel vulnerabilities. To this end, we present DIJA, the first\nsystematic study and jailbreak attack framework that exploits unique safety\nweaknesses of dLLMs. Specifically, our proposed DIJA constructs adversarial\ninterleaved mask-text prompts that exploit the text generation mechanisms of\ndLLMs, i.e., bidirectional modeling and parallel decoding. Bidirectional\nmodeling drives the model to produce contextually consistent outputs for masked\nspans, even when harmful, while parallel decoding limits model dynamic\nfiltering and rejection sampling of unsafe content. This causes standard\nalignment mechanisms to fail, enabling harmful completions in alignment-tuned\ndLLMs, even when harmful behaviors or unsafe instructions are directly exposed\nin the prompt. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that DIJA\nsignificantly outperforms existing jailbreak methods, exposing a previously\noverlooked threat surface in dLLM architectures. Notably, our method achieves\nup to 100% keyword-based ASR on Dream-Instruct, surpassing the strongest prior\nbaseline, ReNeLLM, by up to 78.5% in evaluator-based ASR on JailbreakBench and\nby 37.7 points in StrongREJECT score, while requiring no rewriting or hiding of\nharmful content in the jailbreak prompt.

    "summary": "With the breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), query generation\ntechniques that expand documents and queries with related terms are becoming\nincreasingly popular in the information retrieval field. Such techniques have\nbeen shown to improve the effectiveness of traditional lexical retrieval\nmethods by dealing with the vocabulary mismatch problem. Recent work has found\nthat generating queries with a greedy decoding strategy can produce sub-optimal\nqueries, including hallucinations, and proposed to filter out queries before\nexpansion. This `generate-then-filter' approach is costly, as it requires\ngenerating multiple queries and applying a relevance model to all of them and\ndoes not teach the LLM which of the generated queries is more effective for\nexpansion. To overcome such limitations, we propose Aligned Query Expansion\n(AQE), a novel approach to enhance query expansion for passage retrieval in\nopen-domain question answering. AQE leverages recent techniques in LLM\nalignment to fine-tune models for generating query expansions that directly\noptimize the effectiveness of the retrieval task, eliminating the need for\nadditional filtering steps. This alignment ensures that queries are more\nrelevant, reducing computational costs while improving retrieval effectiveness.\nEmpirical evaluations show that AQE outperforms baseline models for query\nexpansion in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in retrieval effectiveness.",

How well do these models\nalign with human performance in detecting and mapping analogies? Prior research\nhas shown that LLMs can extract similarities from analogy problems but lack\nrobust human-like reasoning. Building on Webb, Holyoak, and Lu (2023), the\ncurrent study focused on a story-based analogical mapping task and conducted a\nfine-grained evaluation of LLM reasoning abilities compared to human\nperformance. First, it explored the semantic representation of analogies in\nLLMs, using sentence embeddings to assess whether they capture the similarity\nbetween the source and target texts of an analogy, and the dissimilarity\nbetween the source and distractor texts. Second, it investigated the\neffectiveness of explicitly prompting LLMs to explain analogies. Throughout, we\nexamine whether LLMs exhibit similar performance profiles to those observed in\nhumans by evaluating their reasoning at the level of individual analogies, and\nnot just at the level of overall accuracy (as prior studies have done). Our\nexperiments include evaluating the impact of model size (8B vs. 70B parameters)\nand performance variation across state-of-the-art model architectures such as\nGPT-4 and LLaMA3.

Six frontier models, including\nthree \"reasoning-tuned\" versions, solve each mutated prompt, and their Python\noutputs are checked against the original test suites to reveal whether they\nreused the baseline solution or adapted. Among 11 853 generations we observe a\nsharp double asymmetry.

    "summary": "Recently, much effort has been devoted to modeling users' multi-interests\nbased on their behaviors or auxiliary signals. However, existing methods often\nrely on heuristic assumptions, e.g., co-occurring items indicate the same\ninterest of users, failing to capture user multi-interests aligning with\nreal-world scenarios. While large language models (LLMs) show significant\npotential for multi-interest analysis due to their extensive knowledge and\npowerful reasoning capabilities, two key challenges remain. First, the\ngranularity of LLM-driven multi-interests is agnostic, possibly leading to\noverly fine or coarse interest grouping. Second, individual user analysis\nprovides limited insights due to the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we\npropose an LLM-driven dual-level multi-interest modeling framework for more\neffective recommendation. At the user-individual level, we exploit LLMs to\nflexibly allocate items engaged by users into different semantic clusters,\nindicating their diverse and distinct interests. To alleviate the agnostic\ngeneration of LLMs, we adaptively assign these semantic clusters to users'\ncollaborative multi-interests learned from global user-item interactions,\nallowing the granularity to be automatically adjusted according to the user's\nbehaviors using an alignment module. To alleviate the limited insights derived\nfrom individual users' behaviors, at the user-crowd level, we propose\naggregating user cliques into synthesized users with rich behaviors for more\ncomprehensive LLM-driven multi-interest analysis. We formulate a max covering\nproblem to ensure the compactness and representativeness of synthesized users'\nbehaviors, and then conduct contrastive learning based on their LLM-driven\nmulti-interests to disentangle item representations among different interests.\nExperiments on real-world datasets show the superiority of our approach against\nstate-of-the-art methods.",

When LLMs\nact as judges, the ability to fairly resolve judicial issues is a prerequisite\nto ensure their trustworthiness. Based on theories of judicial fairness, we\nconstruct a comprehensive framework to measure LLM fairness, leading to a\nselection of 65 labels and 161 corresponding values. Applying this framework to\nthe judicial system, we compile an extensive dataset, JudiFair, comprising\n177,100 unique case facts. To achieve robust statistical inference, we develop\nthree evaluation metrics, inconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy, and\nintroduce a method to assess the overall fairness of multiple LLMs across\nvarious labels. Through experiments with 16 LLMs, we uncover pervasive\ninconsistency, bias, and imbalanced inaccuracy across models, underscoring\nsevere LLM judicial unfairness. Particularly, LLMs display notably more\npronounced biases on demographic labels, with slightly less bias on substance\nlabels compared to procedure ones. Interestingly, increased inconsistency\ncorrelates with reduced biases, but more accurate predictions exacerbate\nbiases. While we find that adjusting the temperature parameter can influence\nLLM fairness, model size, release date, and country of origin do not exhibit\nsignificant effects on judicial fairness.

    "summary": "Software libraries are central to the functionality, security, and\nmaintainability of modern code. As developers increasingly turn to Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to assist with programming tasks, understanding how\nthese models recommend libraries is essential. In this paper, we conduct an\nempirical study of six state-of-the-art LLMs, both proprietary and open-source,\nby prompting them to solve real-world Python problems sourced from Stack\nOverflow. We analyze the types of libraries they import, the characteristics of\nthose libraries, and the extent to which the recommendations are usable out of\nthe box. Our results show that LLMs predominantly favour third-party libraries\nover standard ones, and often recommend mature, popular, and permissively\nlicensed dependencies. However, we also identify gaps in usability: 4.6% of the\nlibraries could not be resolved automatically due to structural mismatches\nbetween import names and installable packages, and only two models (out of six)\nprovided installation guidance. While the generated code is technically valid,\nthe lack of contextual support places the burden of manually resolving\ndependencies on the user. Our findings offer actionable insights for both\ndevelopers and researchers, and highlight opportunities to improve the\nreliability and usability of LLM-generated code in the context of software\ndependencies.",

We\nevaluated the feasibility of using LLMs to replicate expert-driven thematic\nanalysis of social media data. Methods Using two temporally non-intersecting\nReddit datasets on xylazine (n=286 and n=686, for model optimization and\nvalidation, respectively) with twelve expert-derived themes, we evaluated five\nLLMs against expert coding. We modeled the task as a series of binary\nclassifications, rather than a single, multi-label classification, employing\nzero-, single-, and few-shot prompting strategies and measuring performance via\naccuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Results On the validation set,\nGPT-4o with two-shot prompting performed best (accuracy: 90.9%; F1-score:\n0.71). For high-prevalence themes, model-derived thematic distributions closely\nmirrored expert classifications (e.g., xylazine use: 13.6% vs. 17.8%; MOUD use:\n16.5% vs. 17.8%).

SC-ADAS\nsupports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing\nnatural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented\nin the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes\nconfirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model\nfine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and\nrevisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased\nlatency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated\ndialogue history.

    "summary": "The concept of the Web of Agents (WoA), which transforms the static,\ndocument-centric Web into an environment of autonomous agents acting on users'\nbehalf, has attracted growing interest as large language models (LLMs) become\nmore capable. However, research in this area is still fragmented across\ndifferent communities. Contemporary surveys catalog the latest LLM-powered\nframeworks, while the rich histories of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) and the\nSemantic Web are often treated as separate, legacy domains. This fragmentation\nobscures the intellectual lineage of modern systems and hinders a holistic\nunderstanding of the field's trajectory. We present the first comprehensive\nevolutionary overview of the WoA. We show that modern protocols like A2A and\nthe MCP, are direct evolutionary responses to the well-documented limitations\nof earlier standards like FIPA standards and OWL-based semantic agents. To\nsystematize this analysis, we introduce a four-axis taxonomy (semantic\nfoundation, communication paradigm, locus of intelligence, discovery\nmechanism). This framework provides a unified analytical lens for comparing\nagent architectures across all generations, revealing a clear line of descent\nwhere others have seen a disconnect. Our analysis identifies a paradigm shift\nin the 'locus of intelligence': from being encoded in external data (Semantic\nWeb) or the platform (MAS) to being embedded within the agent's core model\n(LLM). This shift is foundational to modern Agentic AI, enabling the scalable\nand adaptive systems the WoA has long envisioned. We conclude that while new\nprotocols are essential, they are insufficient for building a robust, open,\ntrustworthy ecosystem. Finally, we argue that the next research frontier lies\nin solving persistent socio-technical challenges, and we map out a new agenda\nfocused on decentralized identity, economic models, security, and governance\nfor the emerging WoA.",

    "title": "A Code Comprehension Benchmark for Large Language Models for Code",
    "summary": "Large Language Models have shown impressive capabilities in coding tasks like\ncode generation and code completion, as they have been trained on a large\namount of code data. Also, since one of the core pretraining objectives is Next\nToken Prediction, these models tends to learn surface-level syntactic patterns\nin code. However, this does not guarantee code comprehension ability i.e. the\nability to capture the semantics of the code. In our opinion, this is the\nreason why these models often underperform on tasks that require deeper\nsemantic understanding, such as code debugging and code optimization. To\naddress this, we propose fine-tuning these models specifically for code\ncomprehension tasks using large-scale datasets, enabling them to develop a more\nrobust understanding of code semantics. We evaluate three code models of\nvarying sizes on a suite of code comprehension tasks designed to assess\nsemantic understanding beyond surface-level syntactic pattern matching. In\nparticular, we analyze performance on the Subjectivity Grading Task and observe\nthat model performance improves after fine-tuning on relevant downstream tasks.\nThe most significant improvement is seen in the QWQ-32B model, where accuracy\nincreases from 70% to 83.47%. A similar or explainable trend is observed across\nother models, clearly indicating an enhancement in code comprehension ability.\nAmong the models studied, the DPO-fine-tuned Codestral-22B achieves the highest\nmicro-accuracy of 87.66% on the Subjectivity Grading Task.",

However, training on\nheterogeneous clusters presents several challenges, including load balancing\nacross GPUs, optimizing memory usage to accommodate varying memory capacities,\nand ensuring communication-efficient training over diverse network\ninterconnects potentially spanning multiple datacenters. In this paper, we make\nthe case that efficient training on heterogeneous clusters requires (1) the\nintegration of pipeline parallelism and data parallelism in a manner that is\nboth communication- and memory-efficient, and (2) a more adaptable\nconfiguration of pipeline and data parallelism, which includes the capability\nto flexibly partition GPUs into asymmetric pipeline parallel stages and to\nincorporate heterogeneous GPUs within the same data parallelism group.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in vision-language understanding, reasoning, and generation.\nHowever, they struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained localization and\nreasoning in high-resolution images. This constraint stems from the fact that\nMLLMs are fine-tuned with fixed image resolution to align with the pre-trained\nimage encoder used in MLLM. Consequently, feeding high-resolution images\ndirectly into MLLMs leads to poor generalization due to a train-test resolution\ndiscrepancy, while downsampling these images-although ensuring\nconsistency-compromises fine-grained visual details and ultimately degrades\nperformance. To address this challenge, we propose Extract Candidate then\nPredict (ECP), a novel training-free, task-agnostic two-stage framework\ndesigned to enhance MLLM performance on high-resolution images. The key\nintuition behind ECP is that while MLLMs struggle with high-resolution images,\ntheir predictions on downsampled images still contain implicit localization\ncues. By first identifying candidate region using the coarse prediction and\nthen predicting the final output based on candidate region, ECP effectively\npreserves fine-grained details while mitigating the challenges posed by\nhigh-resolution data. We validate our framework on 4K GUI grounding and 4K, 8K\nMLLM perception, achieving +21.3%, +5.8%, +5.2% absolute improvement compared\nto baseline respectively, demonstrating its effectiveness.

    "summary": "Transformers are the driving force behind today's Large Language Models\n(LLMs), serving as the foundation for their performance and versatility. Yet,\ntheir compute and memory costs grow with sequence length, posing scalability\nchallenges for long-context inferencing. In response, the algorithm community\nis exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs),\nlinear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as\npost-transformers. This shift presents a key challenge: building a serving\nsystem that efficiently supports both transformer and post-transformer LLMs\nwithin a unified framework. To address this challenge, we analyze the\nperformance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite\ntheir algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory\nbandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state\nupdates in post-transformers. Further analyses suggest two additional insights:\n(1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making\nper-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision\narithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify\nMicrosoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we\ndesign Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared\nbetween two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a\nState-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers\nand adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of\nstate update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to\nLLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 3.2x and 2.1x\nhigher token generation throughput, respectively.",

    "summary": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) in general and feature distillation in particular\nare promising techniques for reducing the high computational demand of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). However, traditional feature KD methods typically\nassume that the teacher and the student share the same hidden size, limiting\nthe flexibility of the student's architecture. A common solution to this\nproblem involves training a linear projector to align their feature spaces, but\nthis introduces additional parameters that must be learned from scratch and\noften degrades performance on downstream tasks, especially in generative\nsettings. To address this issue, in this work, we propose a novel task-based\nfeature distillation method that enables knowledge transfer between teacher and\nstudent models with different hidden layer dimensions, without introducing any\nnew parameters. Leveraging the insight that only a subset of LLM components\ncontribute significantly to a specific downstream task, our approach identifies\nthe most task-relevant hidden units in the teacher and directly distills their\nactivations to the student.

    "summary": "The exploration and application of Large Language Models (LLMs) is thriving.\nTo reduce deployment costs, continuous batching has become an essential feature\nin current service frameworks. The effectiveness of continuous batching relies\non an accurate estimate of the memory requirements of requests. However, due to\nthe diversity in request output lengths, existing frameworks tend to adopt\naggressive or conservative schedulers, which often result in significant\noverestimation or underestimation of memory consumption. Consequently, they\nsuffer from harmful request evictions or prolonged queuing times, failing to\nachieve satisfactory throughput under strict Service Level Agreement (SLA)\nguarantees (a.k.a. goodput), across various LLM application scenarios with\ndiffering input-output length distributions. To address this issue, we propose\na novel Past-Future scheduler that precisely estimates the peak memory\nresources required by the running batch via considering the historical\ndistribution of request output lengths and calculating memory occupancy at each\nfuture time point. It adapts to applications with all types of input-output\nlength distributions, balancing the trade-off between request queuing and\nharmful evictions, thereby consistently achieving better goodput. Furthermore,\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheduler, we developed a\nhigh-performance LLM serving framework, LightLLM, that implements the\nPast-Future scheduler. Compared to existing aggressive or conservative\nschedulers, LightLLM demonstrates superior goodput, achieving up to 2-3$\\times$\nhigher goodput than other schedulers under heavy loads. LightLLM is open source\nto boost the research in such direction (https://github.com/ModelTC/lightllm).",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as code assistants, yet\ntheir behavior when explicitly asked to generate insecure code remains poorly\nunderstood. While prior research has focused on unintended vulnerabilities,\nthis study examines a more direct threat: open-source LLMs generating\nvulnerable code when prompted. We propose a dual experimental design: (1)\nDynamic Prompting, which systematically varies vulnerability type, user\npersona, and prompt phrasing across structured templates; and (2) Reverse\nPrompting, which derives natural-language prompts from real vulnerable code\nsamples. We evaluate three open-source 7B-parameter models (Qwen2, Mistral,\nGemma) using static analysis to assess both the presence and correctness of\ngenerated vulnerabilities. Our results show that all models frequently generate\nthe requested vulnerabilities, though with significant performance differences.\nGemma achieves the highest correctness for memory vulnerabilities under Dynamic\nPrompting (e.g., 98.6% for buffer overflows), while Qwen2 demonstrates the most\nbalanced performance across all tasks. We find that professional personas\n(e.g., \"DevOps Engineer\") consistently elicit higher success rates than student\npersonas, and that the effectiveness of direct versus indirect phrasing is\ninverted depending on the prompting strategy. Vulnerability reproduction\naccuracy follows a non-linear pattern with code complexity, peaking in a\nmoderate range. Our findings expose how LLMs' reliance on pattern recall over\nsemantic reasoning creates significant blind spots in their safety alignments,\nparticularly for requests framed as plausible professional tasks.",

    "title": "Reprogramming Vision Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting",
    "summary": "Foundation models have achieved remarkable success in natural language\nprocessing and computer vision, demonstrating strong capabilities in modeling\ncomplex patterns. While recent efforts have explored adapting large language\nmodels (LLMs) for time-series forecasting, LLMs primarily capture\none-dimensional sequential dependencies and struggle to model the richer\nspatio-temporal (ST) correlations essential for accurate ST forecasting. In\nthis paper, we present \\textbf{ST-VFM}, a novel framework that systematically\nreprograms Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for general-purpose spatio-temporal\nforecasting. While VFMs offer powerful spatial priors, two key challenges arise\nwhen applying them to ST tasks: (1) the lack of inherent temporal modeling\ncapacity and (2) the modality gap between visual and ST data. To address these,\nST-VFM adopts a \\emph{dual-branch architecture} that integrates raw ST inputs\nwith auxiliary ST flow inputs, where the flow encodes lightweight temporal\ndifference signals interpretable as dynamic spatial cues. To effectively\nprocess these dual-branch inputs, ST-VFM introduces two dedicated reprogramming\nstages. The \\emph{pre-VFM reprogramming} stage applies a Temporal-Aware Token\nAdapter to embed temporal context and align both branches into VFM-compatible\nfeature spaces. The \\emph{post-VFM reprogramming} stage introduces a Bilateral\nCross-Prompt Coordination module, enabling dynamic interaction between branches\nthrough prompt-based conditioning, thus enriching joint representation learning\nwithout modifying the frozen VFM backbone. Extensive experiments on ten\nspatio-temporal datasets show that ST-VFM outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines, demonstrating effectiveness and robustness across VFM backbones\n(e.g., DINO, CLIP, DEIT) and ablation studies, establishing it as a strong\ngeneral framework for spatio-temporal forecasting.",

There have therefore been several\nrecent works that propose the use of LLMs as an alternative to single-cell\nfoundation models, achieving competitive results. However, there is little\nunderstanding of what factors drive this performance, along with a strong focus\non using LLMs as an alternative, rather than complementary approach to\nsingle-cell foundation models. In this study, we therefore investigate what\nbiological insights contribute toward the performance of LLMs when applied to\nsingle-cell data, and introduce scMPT; a model which leverages synergies\nbetween scGPT, and single-cell representations from LLMs that capture these\ninsights. scMPT demonstrates stronger, more consistent performance than either\nof its component models, which frequently have large performance gaps between\neach other across datasets.

Models like Stable Diffusion introduce\nunavoidable delays and substantial resource overhead, which are unsuitable for\nusers at the network edge with high QoS demands.

To\naddress these issues, this paper introduces a QoS-aware\n\\underline{E}dge-collaborative \\underline{A}IGC \\underline{T}ask scheduling\n(EAT) algorithm. Specifically: 1) We segment AIGC tasks and schedule patches to\nvarious edge servers, formulating it as a gang scheduling problem that balances\ninference latency and quality while considering server heterogeneity, such as\ndiffering model distributions and cold start issues. 2) We propose a\nreinforcement learning-based EAT algorithm that uses an attention layer to\nextract load and task queue information from edge servers and employs a\ndiffusion-based policy network for scheduling, efficiently enabling model\nreuse. 3) We develop an AIGC task scheduling system that uses our EAT algorithm\nto divide tasks and distribute them across multiple edge servers for\nprocessing. Experimental results based on our system and large-scale\nsimulations show that our EAT algorithm can reduce inference latency by up to\n56\\% compared to baselines.

Therefore, this study\nproposes a novel framework for predicting subsequent suicide risk by jointly\nlearning the dynamic influence of both risk factors and protective factors on\nusers' suicide risk transitions. We propose a novel Protective Factor-Aware\nDataset, which is built from 12 years of Reddit posts along with comprehensive\nannotations of suicide risk and both risk and protective factors. We also\nintroduce a Dynamic Factors Influence Learning approach that captures the\nvarying impact of risk and protective factors on suicide risk transitions,\nrecognizing that suicide risk fluctuates over time according to established\npsychological theories. Our thorough experiments demonstrate that the proposed\nmodel significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models and large language\nmodels across three datasets.

LoRA is also communication-efficient for federated\nLLMs when multiple users collaboratively fine-tune a global LLM model without\nsharing their proprietary raw data. However, even the transmission of local\nadapters between a server and clients risks serious privacy leakage. Applying\ndifferential privacy (DP) to federated LoRA encounters a dilemma: adding noise\nto both adapters amplifies synthetic noise on the model, while fixing one\nadapter impairs the learnability of fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose\nFedASK (Differentially Private Federated Low Rank Adaptation with Double\nSketching) , a novel federated LoRA framework to enable effective updating of\nboth low-rank adapters with robust differential privacy. Inspired by randomized\nSVD, our key idea is a two-stage sketching pipeline. This pipeline first\naggregates carefully sketched, privacy-preserving local updates, and then\nreconstructs the global matrices on the server to facilitate effective updating\nof both adapters.

Iceberg improves the geometric mean modeling accuracy by $86.4\\%$ when\nadapt to six real-world applications with few-shot examples and achieves a\n$2.47\\times$ and a $1.12\\times$ better offline DSE performance when adapting to\ntwo different test datasets.

    "summary": "Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,\nposing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to\nremove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such\napproaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show\nthat the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically\nplausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language\nabilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we\nput forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization\nby design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of\nmemorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the\ndynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates\nisolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising\ngeneral language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter\nand billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong\ngeneralization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real\ndata demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is\nachievable.

This paper presents a novel methodology for\ninterpreting how an LLM encodes and utilizes domain-specific knowledge, using a\nBoiling Water Reactor system as a case study. We adapted a general-purpose LLM\n(Gemma-3-1b-it) to the nuclear domain using a parameter-efficient fine-tuning\ntechnique known as Low-Rank Adaptation. By comparing the neuron activation\npatterns of the base model to those of the fine-tuned model, we identified a\nsparse set of neurons whose behavior was significantly altered during the\nadaptation process. To probe the causal role of these specialized neurons, we\nemployed a neuron silencing technique. Our results demonstrate that while\nsilencing most of these specialized neurons individually did not produce a\nstatistically significant effect, deactivating the entire group collectively\nled to a statistically significant degradation in task performance. Qualitative\nanalysis further revealed that silencing these neurons impaired the model's\nability to generate detailed, contextually accurate technical information. This\npaper provides a concrete methodology for enhancing the transparency of an\nopaque black-box model, allowing domain expertise to be traced to verifiable\nneural circuits.

This paper offers a structural diagnosis of such\nfailures, revealing a persistent gap between \\textit{comprehension} and\n\\textit{competence}. Through controlled experiments and architectural analysis,\nwe demonstrate that LLMs often articulate correct principles without reliably\napplying them--a failure rooted not in knowledge access, but in computational\nexecution. We term this phenomenon the computational \\textit{split-brain\nsyndrome}, where instruction and action pathways are geometrically and\nfunctionally dissociated. This core limitation recurs across domains, from\nmathematical operations to relational inferences, and explains why model\nbehavior remains brittle even under idealized prompting.

Our findings delineate the\nboundary of current LLM capabilities and motivate future models with\nmetacognitive control, principle lifting, and structurally grounded execution.\nThis diagnosis also clarifies why mechanistic interpretability findings may\nreflect training-specific pattern coordination rather than universal\ncomputational principles, and why the geometric separation between instruction\nand execution pathways suggests limitations in neural introspection and\nmechanistic analysis.",

However, it remains unclear what mechanisms\ninside the model drive such task-level generalization. In this work, we\napproach this question through the lens of off-by-one addition (i.e., 1+1=3,\n2+2=5, 3+3=?), a two-step, counterfactual task with an unexpected +1 function\nas a second step. Leveraging circuit-style interpretability techniques such as\npath patching, we analyze the models' internal computations behind their\nnotable performance and present three key findings. First, we uncover a\nfunction induction mechanism that explains the model's generalization from\nstandard addition to off-by-one addition. This mechanism resembles the\nstructure of the induction head mechanism found in prior work and elevates it\nto a higher level of abstraction. Second, we show that the induction of the +1\nfunction is governed by multiple attention heads in parallel, each of which\nemits a distinct piece of the +1 function. Finally, we find that this function\ninduction mechanism is reused in a broader range of tasks, including synthetic\ntasks such as shifted multiple-choice QA and algorithmic tasks such as base-8\naddition. Overall, our findings offer deeper insights into how reusable and\ncomposable structures within language models enable task-level generalization.",

Traditional cybersecurity\nmethods rely on manual responses and brittle heuristics. To build proactive and\nintelligent defense systems, we need integrated theoretical frameworks and\nsoftware tools. Game theory provides a rigorous foundation for modeling\nadversarial behavior, designing strategic defenses, and enabling trust in\nautonomous systems. Meanwhile, software tools process cyber data, visualize\nattack surfaces, verify compliance, and suggest mitigations. Yet a disconnect\nremains between theory and practical implementation.\n  The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and agentic AI offers a new path to\nbridge this gap. LLM-powered agents can operationalize abstract strategies into\nreal-world decisions. Conversely, game theory can inform the reasoning and\ncoordination of these agents across complex workflows. LLMs also challenge\nclassical game-theoretic assumptions, such as perfect rationality or static\npayoffs, prompting new models aligned with cognitive and computational\nrealities. This co-evolution promises richer theoretical foundations and novel\nsolution concepts. Agentic AI also reshapes software design: systems must now\nbe modular, adaptive, and trust-aware from the outset.\n  This chapter explores the intersection of game theory, agentic AI, and\ncybersecurity. We review key game-theoretic frameworks (e.g., static, dynamic,\nBayesian, and signaling games) and solution concepts. We then examine how LLM\nagents can enhance cyber defense and introduce LLM-driven games that embed\nreasoning into AI agents. Finally, we explore multi-agent workflows and\ncoordination games, outlining how this convergence fosters secure, intelligent,\nand adaptive cyber systems.",

    "summary": "Autoregressive next-token prediction with the Transformer decoder has become\na de facto standard in large language models (LLMs), achieving remarkable\nsuccess in Natural Language Processing (NLP) at scale. Extending this paradigm\nto audio poses unique challenges due to its inherently continuous nature. We\nresearch audio generation with a causal language model (LM) without discrete\ntokens. We leverage token-wise diffusion to model the continuous distribution\nof the next continuous-valued token. Our approach delivers significant\nimprovements over previous discrete solution, AudioGen, achieving 20% and 40%\nrelative gains on AudioCaps in Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) and\nKullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, respectively. Additionally, we propose a\nnovel masked next-token prediction task that incorporates masked prediction\ninto the causal LM framework. On AudioCaps, the innovation yields 41% and 33%\nrelative FAD improvements over AudioGen Base (285M) and AudioGen Large (1B)\nmodels, respectively, and is on par with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) diffusion\nmodels. Furthermore, we achieve these results with significantly fewer\nparameters -- 193M for our Base and 462M for our Large models.",

In this paper,\nwe introduce a practical framework for evaluating application-level safety in\nLLM systems, validated through real-world deployment across multiple use cases\nwithin our organization.

We illustrate how the proposed\nframework was applied in our internal pilot, providing a reference point for\norganizations seeking to scale their safety testing efforts.

Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains\nlargely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate\nthis process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence\nrepresentations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the\npotential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this\nwork, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models\nannotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our\npipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs\nto generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural\nlanguage descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this\napproach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail\nto reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and\ntopological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler\ncharacteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and\nablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that\nCADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of\nnew objects.

    "summary": "A key assumption fuelling optimism about the progress of large language\nmodels (LLMs) in accurately and comprehensively modelling the world is that the\ntruth is systematic: true statements about the world form a whole that is not\njust consistent, in that it contains no contradictions, but coherent, in that\nthe truths are inferentially interlinked. This holds out the prospect that LLMs\nmight in principle rely on that systematicity to fill in gaps and correct\ninaccuracies in the training data: consistency and coherence promise to\nfacilitate progress towards comprehensiveness in an LLM's representation of the\nworld. However, philosophers have identified compelling reasons to doubt that\nthe truth is systematic across all domains of thought, arguing that in\nnormative domains, in particular, the truth is largely asystematic. I argue\nthat insofar as the truth in normative domains is asystematic, this renders it\ncorrespondingly harder for LLMs to make progress, because they cannot then\nleverage the systematicity of truth. And the less LLMs can rely on the\nsystematicity of truth, the less we can rely on them to do our practical\ndeliberation for us, because the very asystematicity of normative domains\nrequires human agency to play a greater role in practical thought.",

    "summary": "The integration of large language models (LLMs) into automated algorithm\ndesign has shown promising potential. A prevalent approach embeds LLMs within\nsearch routines to iteratively generate and refine candidate algorithms.\nHowever, most existing methods rely on off-the-shelf LLMs trained for general\ncoding tasks,leaving a key question open: Do we need LLMs specifically tailored\nfor algorithm design? If so, how can such LLMs be effectively obtained and how\nwell can they generalize across different algorithm design tasks? In this\npaper, we take a first step toward answering these questions by exploring\nfine-tuning of LLMs for algorithm design. We introduce a Diversity-Aware Rank\nbased (DAR) sampling strategy to balance training data diversity and quality,\nthen we leverage direct preference optimization to efficiently align LLM\noutputs with task objectives. Our experiments, conducted on\nLlama-3.2-1B-Instruct and Llama- 3.1-8B-Instruct, span three distinct algorithm\ndesign tasks. Results suggest that finetuned LLMs can significantly outperform\ntheir off-the-shelf counterparts with the smaller Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct and\nmatch the larger Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the admissible set problem. Moreover,\nwe observe promising generalization: LLMs finetuned on specific algorithm\ndesign tasks also improve performance on related tasks with varying settings.\nThese findings highlight the value of task-specific adaptation for LLMs in\nalgorithm design and open new avenues for future research.",

    "summary": "The growing scale of large language models (LLMs) not only demands extensive\ncomputational resources but also raises environmental concerns due to their\nincreasing carbon footprint. Model quantization emerges as an effective\napproach that can reduce the resource demands of LLMs by decreasing parameter\nprecision without substantially affecting performance (e.g., 16 bit to 4 bit).\nWhile recent studies have established quantization as a promising approach for\noptimizing large code models (LCMs), a specialized subset of LLMs tailored for\nautomated software engineering, their findings offer only limited insights into\nits practical implications. Specifically, current investigations focus only on\nthe functional correctness of the code generated by quantized models,\nneglecting how quantization impacts critical aspects of code quality such as\nreliability, maintainability, and security. To bridge this gap, our study\ninvestigates the effects of quantization on the qualitative aspects of\nautomatically generated code.

First, we demonstrate,\nthrough a large-scale multilingual human study with representative samples from\nfive countries (N=15,000), that humans exhibit significantly more variation in\npreferences than the responses of 21 state-of-the-art LLMs. Second, we show\nthat existing methods for preference dataset collection are insufficient for\nlearning the diversity of human preferences even along two of the most salient\ndimensions of variability in global values, due to the underlying homogeneity\nof candidate responses. Third, we argue that this motivates the need for\nnegatively-correlated sampling when generating candidate sets, and we show that\nsimple prompt-based techniques for doing so significantly enhance the\nperformance of alignment methods in learning heterogeneous preferences. Fourth,\nbased on this novel candidate sampling approach, we collect and open-source\nCommunity Alignment, the largest and most representative multilingual and\nmulti-turn preference dataset to date, featuring almost 200,000 comparisons\nfrom annotators spanning five countries.

However, they remain highly vulnerable to\npop-up-based environmental injection attacks, where malicious visual elements\ndivert model attention and lead to unsafe or incorrect actions. Existing\ndefense methods either require costly retraining or perform poorly under\ninductive interference. In this work, we systematically study how such attacks\nalter the attention behavior of GUI agents and uncover a layer-wise attention\ndivergence pattern between correct and incorrect outputs. Based on this\ninsight, we propose \\textbf{LaSM}, a \\textit{Layer-wise Scaling Mechanism} that\nselectively amplifies attention and MLP modules in critical layers.

Extensive experiments across 12 types of pop-up\nperturbations and 4 different model backbones show that LaSM consistently\nenhances the defense success rate.

We\nprovide both a quantitative analysis and qualitative insights into how the\nmodels respond to increasing noise in the user prompt.\n  The prompt quality strongly affects the translation performance: With many\nerrors, even a good prompt can underperform a minimal or poor prompt without\nerrors. However, different noise types impact translation quality differently,\nwith character-level and combined noisers degrading performance more than\nphrasal perturbations. Qualitative analysis reveals that lower prompt quality\nlargely leads to poorer instruction following, rather than directly affecting\ntranslation quality itself.

    "title": "A Mixture of Linear Corrections Generates Secure Code",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have become proficient at sophisticated\ncode-generation tasks, yet remain ineffective at reliably detecting or avoiding\ncode vulnerabilities. Does this deficiency stem from insufficient learning\nabout code vulnerabilities, or is it merely a result of ineffective prompting?\nUsing representation engineering techniques, we investigate whether LLMs\ninternally encode the concepts necessary to identify code vulnerabilities. We\nfind that current LLMs encode precise internal representations that distinguish\nvulnerable from secure code--achieving greater accuracy than standard prompting\napproaches. Leveraging these vulnerability-sensitive representations, we\ndevelop an inference-time steering technique that subtly modulates the model's\ntoken-generation probabilities through a mixture of corrections (MoC). Our\nmethod effectively guides LLMs to produce less vulnerable code without\ncompromising functionality, demonstrating a practical approach to controlled\nvulnerability management in generated code. Notably, MoC enhances the security\nratio of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B by 8.9\\%, while simultaneously improving\nfunctionality on HumanEval pass@1 by 2.1\\%.",

    "summary": "Playtesting is the process in which people play a video game for testing. It\nis critical for the quality assurance of gaming software. Manual playtesting is\ntime-consuming and expensive. However, automating this process is challenging,\nas playtesting typically requires domain knowledge and problem-solving skills\nthat most conventional testing tools lack. Recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence (AI) have opened up new possibilities for applying Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to playtesting. However, significant challenges remain: current\nLLMs cannot visually perceive game environments, and most existing research\nfocuses on text-based games or games with robust APIs. Many non-text games lack\nAPIs to provide textual descriptions of game states, making it almost\nimpossible to naively apply LLMs for playtesting. This paper introduces Lap,\nour novel approach to LLM-based Automatic Playtesting, which uses ChatGPT to\ntest match-3 games, a category of games where players match three or more\nidentical tiles in a row or column to earn points. Lap encompasses three key\nphases: processing of game environments, prompting-based action generation, and\naction execution. Given a match-3 game, Lap takes a snapshot of the game board\nand converts it to a numeric matrix. It then prompts the ChatGPT-O1-mini API to\nsuggest moves based on that matrix and tentatively applies the suggested moves\nto earn points and trigger changes in the game board. It repeats the\nabove-mentioned three steps iteratively until timeout. For evaluation, we\nconducted a case study using Lap on an open-source match-3 game, CasseBonbons,\nand empirically compared it with three existing tools. Our results are\npromising: Lap outperformed existing tools by achieving higher code coverage\nand triggering more program crashes. This research sheds light on the future of\nautomatic testing and LLM applications.",

In this paper, we introduce M2SaG, a multimodal sarcasm\ngeneration dataset with 4,970 samples, each containing an image, a sarcastic\ntext, and a sarcasm target. To benchmark M2SaG, we propose ViSP, a generation\nframework that integrates Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and contrastive\nlearning. PPO utilizes reward scores from DIP to steer the generation of\nsarcastic texts, while contrastive learning encourages the model to favor\noutputs with higher reward scores. These strategies improve overall generation\nquality and produce texts with more pronounced sarcastic intent. We evaluate\nViSP across five metric sets and find it surpasses all baselines, including\nlarge language models, underscoring their limitations in sarcasm generation.\nFurthermore, we analyze the distributions of Sarcasm Scores and Factual\nIncongruity for both M2SaG and the texts generated by ViSP. The generated texts\nexhibit higher mean Sarcasm Scores (0.898 vs. 0.770) and Factual Incongruity\n(0.768 vs. 0.739), demonstrating that ViSP produces higher-quality sarcastic\ncontent than the original dataset. % The dataset and code will be publicly\navailable.

We further show that these scaling laws can\nextrapolate to new data mixtures and across scales: their parameters can be\naccurately estimated using a few small-scale training runs, and used to\nestimate the performance at larger scales and unseen domain weights. The\nscaling laws allow to derive the optimal domain weights for any target domain\nunder a given training budget ($N$,$D$), providing a principled alternative to\ncostly trial-and-error methods.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) increasingly power conversational agents,\nunderstanding how they model users' emotional states is critical for ethical\ndeployment. Inspired by emotion wheels -- a psychological framework that argues\nemotions organize hierarchically -- we analyze probabilistic dependencies\nbetween emotional states in model outputs. We find that LLMs naturally form\nhierarchical emotion trees that align with human psychological models, and\nlarger models develop more complex hierarchies. We also uncover systematic\nbiases in emotion recognition across socioeconomic personas, with compounding\nmisclassifications for intersectional, underrepresented groups. Human studies\nreveal striking parallels, suggesting that LLMs internalize aspects of social\nperception. Beyond highlighting emergent emotional reasoning in LLMs, our\nresults hint at the potential of using cognitively-grounded theories for\ndeveloping better model evaluations.",

As an\nalternative to conventional turn-by-turn dialogue, users increasingly expect\nmultimodal systems to be more initiative, for example, by autonomously\ndetermining the timing of multi-turn responses in real time during video\nplayback. To facilitate progress in this emerging area, we introduce\nProactiveVideoQA, the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate a system's\nability to engage in proactive interaction. Since model responses are generated\nat varying timestamps, we further propose PAUC, the first metric that accounts\nfor the temporal dynamics of model responses. This enables a more accurate\nevaluation of systems operating in proactive settings. Through extensive\nbenchmarking of various baseline systems on ProactiveVideoQA and a user study\nof human preferences, we show that PAUC is in better agreement with human\npreferences than traditional evaluation metrics, which typically only consider\nthe textual content of responses. These findings demonstrate that PAUC provides\na more faithful assessment of user experience in proactive interaction\nscenarios.

While existing accelerators offload LLM\ninference to expensive heterogeneous computing systems, they fail to exploit\nthe significant sparsity inherent in LLM operations, leaving hardware resources\nunderutilized. We propose SLIM, an algorithm-hardware co-design optimized for\nsparse LLM serving on edge devices. SLIM exploits LLM sparsity through an\nadaptive thresholding algorithm that enables runtime-configurable sparsity with\nnegligible accuracy loss, fetching only activated neurons to dramatically\nreduce data movement. Our heterogeneous hardware architecture strategically\ncombines near-storage processing (NSP) and processing-in-memory (PIM): FFN\nweights are stored in high-density 3D NAND and computed using NSP units, while\nmemory-intensive MHA operations are processed in PIM modules. This design\nsignificantly reduces memory footprint, data movement, and energy consumption.\nOur comprehensive evaluation demonstrates SLIM's effectiveness, achieving\n13-18x throughput improvements over SSD-GPU systems and 9-10x better energy\nefficiency over DRAM-GPU systems while maintaining low latency, making\ncost-effective LLM deployment viable for edge computing environments.",

Evaluations of these techniques assess\ntheir ability to identify genuine links from plausible but false links.\nHowever, these evaluations overlook the fact that, in reality, when a\nrepository has more commits, the presence of more plausible yet unrelated\ncommits may interfere with the tool in differentiating the correct fix commits.\nTo address this, we propose the Realistic Distribution Setting (RDS) and use it\nto construct a more realistic evaluation dataset that includes 20 open-source\nprojects. By evaluating tools on this dataset, we observe that the performance\nof the state-of-the-art deep learning-based approach drops by more than half,\nwhile the traditional Information Retrieval method, VSM, outperforms it.\n  Inspired by these observations, we propose EasyLink, which utilizes a vector\ndatabase as a modern Information Retrieval technique.

This one-off training eliminates the need for\nsubsequent perturbations, enabling efficient explanations for any new sentence.\nWe demonstrate PLEX's effectiveness on four different classification tasks\n(sentiment, fake news, fake COVID-19 news and depression), showing more than\n92\\% agreement with LIME and SHAP. Our evaluation using a ``stress test\"\nreveals that PLEX accurately identifies influential words, leading to a similar\ndecline in classification accuracy as observed with LIME and SHAP when these\nwords are removed. Notably, in some cases, PLEX demonstrates superior\nperformance in capturing the impact of key features. PLEX dramatically\naccelerates explanation, reducing time and computational overhead by two and\nfour orders of magnitude, respectively. This work offers a promising solution\nfor explainable LLM-based text classification.",

    "summary": "Human pose estimation traditionally relies on architectures that encode\nkeypoint priors, limiting their generalization to novel poses or unseen\nkeypoints. Recent language-guided approaches like LocLLM reformulate keypoint\nlocalization as a vision-language task, enabling zero-shot generalization\nthrough textual descriptions. However, LocLLM's linear projector fails to\ncapture complex spatial-textual interactions critical for high-precision\nlocalization. To address this, we propose PoseLLM, the first Large Language\nModel (LLM)-based pose estimation framework that replaces the linear projector\nwith a nonlinear MLP vision-language connector. This lightweight two-layer MLP\nwith GELU activation enables hierarchical cross-modal feature transformation,\nenhancing the fusion of visual patches and textual keypoint descriptions.\nTrained exclusively on COCO data, PoseLLM achieves 77.8 AP on the COCO\nvalidation set, outperforming LocLLM by +0.4 AP, while maintaining strong\nzero-shot generalization on Human-Art and MPII. Our work demonstrates that a\nsimple yet powerful nonlinear connector significantly boosts localization\naccuracy without sacrificing generalization, advancing the state-of-the-art in\nlanguage-guided pose estimation.

    "summary": "Despite improvements in automatic speech recognition, performance drops with\naccented speech. Generative error correction (GER) leverages the linguistic\nknowledge of large language models (LLMs), outperforming typical language model\nmethods. However, it lacks specificity in accented speech scenarios. Accents\nrepresent deviations from standard pronunciation, making multi-granularity\npronunciation and semantic information essential for accented speech\nrecognition. Moreover, accents exhibit considerable diversity, with each accent\npossessing distinct characteristics. In this study, we leverage GER to improve\ntranscription accuracy by addressing the two primary features. We propose the\nmulti-modal GER, which integrates pronunciation information from the speech\nmodality, and the multi-granularity GER, which incorporates fine-grained\nphoneme-level pronunciation information. These methods enable the LLM to\nutilize the pronunciation information of accented speech and the semantic\ninformation from word-level hypotheses for accurate transcription predictions\nthrough low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning. We employ a three-stage\nstrategy to train separate multi-modal GER models for each accent to obtain\nmono-accent LoRA experts. By adopting our proposed HDMoLE method, which\nincorporates hierarchical routing and dynamic thresholds within the mixture of\nLoRA experts, we effectively merge mono-accent LoRA experts within a single\nmulti-modal GER to overcome accent diversity challenges. Furthermore,\nmulti-granularity GER leverages N-best word-level and phoneme-level hypotheses\nfrom the HDMoLE model to predict final transcriptions. Experiments on a\nmulti-accent English dataset show that our methods reduce word error rate by\n67.35% compared to the baseline vanilla Whisper-large-v3 model.",

    "summary": "Recent research has focused on applying speech large language model (SLLM) to\nimprove speech emotion recognition (SER). However, the inherently high frame\nrate in speech modality severely limits the signal processing and understanding\ncapabilities of SLLM. For example, a SLLM with a 4K context window can only\nprocess 80 seconds of audio at 50Hz feature sampling rate before reaching its\ncapacity limit. Input token compression methods used in SLLM overlook the\ncontinuity and inertia of emotions across multiple conversation turns. This\npaper proposes a Dynamic Parameter Memory (DPM) mechanism with contextual\nsemantics and sentence-level emotion encoding, enabling processing of\nunlimited-length audio with limited context windows in SLLM. Specifically, DPM\nprogressively encodes sentence-level information and emotions into a temporary\nLoRA module during inference to effectively \"memorize\" the contextual\ninformation. We trained an emotion SLLM as a backbone and incorporated our DPM\ninto inference for emotion recognition in conversation (ERC).

Traditional methods primarily\nfocus on selecting the best LLM model for optimizing performance, while\nneglecting the critical interplay between the components of the LLM serving\npipeline (context retrieval, query preprocessing, etc.) or the changing latency\nand cost constraints. We introduce ECO-LLM (Edge-Cloud Orchestrator for LLMs),\na novel system that reframes this problem as a joint optimization challenge and\nsolves it by systematically exploring component configurations and dynamically\nselecting optimal strategies at the query level. ECO-LLM consists of two\ncomponents: (1) the ECO-LLM Emulator, which efficiently explores the vast\nconfiguration space utilizing query clustering and pareto-optimal path\nselection, gathering domain-specific performance metrics without exhaustive\nevaluation; and (2) the ECO-LLM Runtime, which leverages these metrics to\ndynamically select optimal resolution strategies for user queries while meeting\nuser-defined Service Level Objectives (SLOs). We evaluate ECO-LLM on a smart\nhome and a smart car assistant scenarios. With an exhaustive exploration of all\npossible configurations for seen queries, ECO-LLM outperforms cloud-based\nmodels like GPT-4o in terms of accuracy (90% vs. 74% on average) while reducing\ncosts by 90% and latency by 55%, demonstrating the value of its joint\noptimization at the query level.

Although this sparsity\npresents opportunities to reduce computational cost, efficiently utilizing it\nrequires predicting activation patterns in a scalable manner. However, direct\nprediction at the neuron level is computationally expensive due to the vast\nnumber of neurons in modern LLMs. To enable efficient prediction and\nutilization of activation sparsity, we propose a clustering-based activation\npattern compression framework. Instead of treating each neuron independently,\nwe group similar activation patterns into a small set of representative\nclusters. Our method achieves up to 79.34% clustering precision, outperforming\nstandard binary clustering approaches while maintaining minimal degradation in\nperplexity (PPL) scores. With a sufficiently large number of clusters, our\napproach attains a PPL score as low as 12.49, demonstrating its effectiveness\nin preserving model quality while reducing computational overhead. By\npredicting cluster assignments rather than individual neuron states, future\nmodels can efficiently infer activation patterns from pre-computed centroids.\nWe detail the clustering algorithm, analyze its effectiveness in capturing\nmeaningful activation structures, and demonstrate its potential to improve\nsparse computation efficiency.

This raises a fundamental question: How can a decoder-only\nTransformer architecture understand underlying graph structures? To address\nthis, we start with the substructure extraction task, interpreting the inner\nmechanisms inside the transformers and analyzing the impact of the input\nqueries. Specifically, through both empirical results and theoretical analysis,\nwe present Induced Substructure Filtration (ISF), a perspective that captures\nthe substructure identification in the multi-layer transformers. We further\nvalidate the ISF process in LLMs, revealing consistent internal dynamics across\nlayers. Building on these insights, we explore the broader capabilities of\nTransformers in handling diverse graph types. Specifically, we introduce the\nconcept of thinking in substructures to efficiently extract complex composite\npatterns, and demonstrate that decoder-only Transformers can successfully\nextract substructures from attributed graphs, such as molecular graphs.\nTogether, our findings offer a new insight on how sequence-based Transformers\nperform the substructure extraction task over graph data.",

    "summary": "While comments are essential for enhancing code readability and\nmaintainability in modern software projects, developers are often motivated to\nupdate code but not comments, leading to outdated or inconsistent documentation\nthat hinders future understanding and maintenance. Recent approaches such as\nCUP and HebCup have attempted automatic comment updating using neural\nsequence-to-sequence models and heuristic rules, respectively. However, these\nmethods can miss or misinterpret crucial information during comment updating,\nresulting in inaccurate comments, and they often struggle with complex update\nscenarios. Given these challenges, a promising direction lies in leveraging\nlarge language models (LLMs), which have shown impressive performance in\nsoftware engineering tasks such as comment generation, code synthesis, and\nprogram repair. This suggests their strong potential to capture the logic\nbehind code modifications - an ability that is crucial for the task of comment\nupdating. Nevertheless, selecting an appropriate prompt strategy for an LLM on\neach update case remains challenging. To address this, we propose a novel\ncomment updating framework, LLMCup, which first uses multiple prompt strategies\nto provide diverse candidate updated comments via an LLM, and then employs a\nranking model, CupRank, to select the best candidate as final updated comment.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLMCup, with improvements\nover state-of-the-art baselines (CUP and HebCup) by 49.0%-116.9% in Accuracy,\n10.8%-20% in BLEU-4, 4.6% in METEOR, 0.9%-1.9% in F1, and 2.1%-3.4% in\nSentenceBert similarity. Furthermore, a user study shows that comments updated\nby LLMCup sometimes surpass human-written updates, highlighting the importance\nof incorporating human evaluation in comment quality assessment.",

Georeferencing\ncomplex locality descriptions associated with these collection samples is a\nhighly labour-intensive task collection agencies struggle with. None of the\nexisting automated methods exploit maps that are an essential tool for\ngeoreferencing complex relations. We present preliminary experiments and\nresults of a novel method that exploits multi-modal capabilities of recent\nLarge Multi-Modal Models (LMM). This method enables the model to visually\ncontextualize spatial relations it reads in the locality description. We use a\ngrid-based approach to adapt these auto-regressive models for this task in a\nzero-shot setting. Our experiments conducted on a small manually annotated\ndataset show impressive results for our approach ($\\sim$1 km Average distance\nerror) compared to uni-modal georeferencing with Large Language Models and\nexisting georeferencing tools. The paper also discusses the findings of the\nexperiments in light of an LMM's ability to comprehend fine-grained maps.\nMotivated by these results, a practical framework is proposed to integrate this\nmethod into a georeferencing workflow.",

Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have achieved advanced accuracy on log parsing, but\ntheir deployment in production environments faces two major limitations: (1)\nthe privacy risks associated with commercial LLMs, driving the adoption of\nlocal deployment, and (2) the stringent latency and throughput requirements\nimposed by high-volume log streams, which existing LLM-based parsers fail to\nmeet. Although recent efforts have reduced the number of LLM queries, they\noverlook the high latency of the LLM invocations, where concurrent log parsing\nrequests can cause serve performance degradation of LLM inference system.\n  In this study, we present InferLog, the first LLM inference optimization\nmethod for online log parsing. Our key insight is that the inference efficiency\nemerges as the vital bottleneck in LLM-based online log parsing, rather than\nparsing accuracy. InferLog accelerates inference by designing (1) A\nPrefix-aware ICL Refinement policy to refine the examples and permutation of\nin-context learning to improve the prefix caching efficiency. (2) A rapid and\ntask-specific configuration tuning pipeline based on meta-learning to find the\noptimal LLM scheduling-related configuration for dynamic log parsing workloads.\nThe experimental results based on Loghub dataset and vLLM demonstrate that\nInferLog significantly outperforms existing inference optimization methods and\nmarkedly accelerates the state-of-the-art LLM-based log parser without\ncompromising parsing accuracy.",

We present a modular toolchain that\nprepares such text data for embedding-based analysis, relying entirely on\nopen-weight models that run on local hardware, requiring only a\nworkstation-level GPU and supporting privacy-sensitive research.\n  The toolchain employs large language model (LLM) prompting to standardize,\nsummarize, and, when needed, translate texts to English for greater\ncomparability. Anonymization is achieved via LLM-based redaction, supplemented\nwith named entity recognition and rule-based methods to minimize the risk of\ndisclosure. We demonstrate the toolchain on a corpus of 10,842 Swedish court\ndecisions under the Care of Abusers Act (LVM), comprising over 56,000 pages.\nEach document is processed into an anonymized, standardized summary and\ntransformed into a document-level embedding.

The findings indicate that LLMs, when\nproperly configured, can effectively support tax professionals in VAT tasks and\nprovide legally grounded justifications for decisions.

In order to efficiently analyze the performance of models and diagnose\nfailures in their answers, it is essential to develop an automated framework to\nsystematically categorize and attribute errors. However, existing evaluation\nmodels lack error attribution capability. In this work, we establish a\ncomprehensive Misattribution Framework with 6 primary and 15 secondary\ncategories to facilitate in-depth analysis. Based on this framework, we present\nAttriData, a dataset specifically designed for error attribution, encompassing\nmisattribution, along with the corresponding scores and feedback. We also\npropose MisAttributionLLM, a fine-tuned model on AttriData, which is the first\ngeneral-purpose judge model capable of simultaneously generating score,\nmisattribution, and feedback. Extensive experiments and analyses are conducted\nto confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method.",

    "summary": "The legal field already uses various large language models (LLMs) in actual\napplications, but their quantitative performance and reasons for it are\nunderexplored. We evaluated several open-source and proprietary LLMs --\nincluding GPT-series, Anthropic, Deepseek and Llama-3, variants -- on parts of\nthe European Qualifying Examination (EQE) for future European Patent Attorneys.\nOpenAI o1 led with 0.82 accuracy and 0.81 F1 score, whereas (Amazon Web\nServices) AWS Llama 3.1 8B lagged at 0.50 accuracy, and a Python-deployed Llama\n3.1 8B scored 0.55. The latter two are within the range of mere guessing for\nthe two-answer forced-choice design. None of the evaluated models could have\npassed the examination fully, as accuracy never exceeded the average threshold\nof 0.90 required for professional-level standards -- also not models that are\nregularly promoted for their assumed beyond-PhD- and bar-admitted-lawyer-level\nperformance. GPT-4o excelled at integrating text and graphics, while Claude 3\nOpus often lost formatting coherence. Human patent experts evaluated the\ntextual justifications and uncovered various critical shortcomings of each\nmodel. They valued clarity and legal rationale over the raw correctness of the\nanswers, which revealed misalignment between automatic metrics and expert\njudgment. Model outputs were sensitive to modest temperature changes and prompt\nwording, which underscores the remaining necessity of expert oversight. Future\nwork should target logical consistency, robust multimodality, and adaptive\nprompting to approach human-level patent proficiency. In summary, despite the\noutstanding performance of recent large models, the general public might\noverestimate their performance. The field has a long way to go to develop a\nvirtual patent attorney. This paper wants to point out several specific\nlimitations that need solutions.",

    "summary": "Decision conferences are structured, collaborative meetings that bring\ntogether experts from various fields to address complex issues and reach a\nconsensus on recommendations for future actions or policies. These conferences\noften rely on facilitated discussions to ensure productive dialogue and\ncollective agreement. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown\nsignificant promise in simulating real-world scenarios, particularly through\ncollaborative multi-agent systems that mimic group interactions. In this work,\nwe present a novel LLM-based multi-agent system designed to simulate decision\nconferences, specifically focusing on detecting agreement among the participant\nagents. To achieve this, we evaluate six distinct LLMs on two tasks: stance\ndetection, which identifies the position an agent takes on a given issue, and\nstance polarity detection, which identifies the sentiment as positive,\nnegative, or neutral. These models are further assessed within the multi-agent\nsystem to determine their effectiveness in complex simulations. Our results\nindicate that LLMs can reliably detect agreement even in dynamic and nuanced\ndebates. Incorporating an agreement-detection agent within the system can also\nimprove the efficiency of group debates and enhance the overall quality and\ncoherence of deliberations, making them comparable to real-world decision\nconferences regarding outcome and decision-making. These findings demonstrate\nthe potential for LLM-based multi-agent systems to simulate group\ndecision-making processes. They also highlight that such systems could be\ninstrumental in supporting decision-making with expert elicitation workshops\nacross various domains.",

    "summary": "Prompt learning facilitates the efficient adaptation of Vision-Language\nModels (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. However, it faces two significant\nchallenges: (1) inadequate modeling of class embedding distributions for unseen\ninstances, leading to suboptimal generalization on novel classes; (2)\nprevailing methodologies predominantly confine cross-modal alignment to the\nfinal output layer of vision and text encoders, which fundamentally limits\ntheir capacity to preserve topological consistency with pre-trained multi-modal\nembedding spaces. To this end, we introduce MuGCP (Multi-modal Mutual-Guidance\nConditional Prompt Learning), a novel paradigm designed for conditional prompt\ngeneration. MuGCP leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as\nconditional prompt learners to adaptively generate Semantic Conditional Prompts\n(SCP) that incorporate rich, fine-grained high-level semantic knowledge for\nimage instances. To ensure effective alignment and interaction across the\nmulti-modal space of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), we introduce the Attention\nMutual-Guidance (AMG) module, which facilitates interactions between visual and\nsemantic information. Through mutual guidance, the AMG module generates Visual\nConditional Prompts (VCP), enhancing the model's performance in multi-modal\ntasks. Additionally, we present a Multi-Prompt Fusion (MPF) mechanism that\nintegrates SCP and VCP with contextual prompts, ensuring seamless coordination\namong the different prompts and enhancing the modeling of class embeddings and\ninstance-specific knowledge. Our MuGCP outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods on 14 different datasets. The code will be made available after\npublication.",

Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results\nindicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for\nintersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0%\n(multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In\nstop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a\nlower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response\ntendency.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in\ndocument image tasks, especially Optical Character Recognition (OCR). However,\nthey struggle with Document Image Machine Translation (DIMT), which requires\nhandling both cross-modal and cross-lingual challenges. Previous efforts to\nenhance DIMT capability through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on the DIMT\ndataset often result in the forgetting of the model's existing monolingual\nabilities, such as OCR. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel\nfine-tuning paradigm, named Synchronously Self-Reviewing (SSR) its OCR\nproficiency, inspired by the concept \"Bilingual Cognitive Advantage\".\nSpecifically, SSR prompts the model to generate OCR text before producing\ntranslation text, which allows the model to leverage its strong monolingual OCR\nability while learning to translate text across languages. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate the proposed SSR learning helps mitigate catastrophic\nforgetting, improving the generalization ability of MLLMs on both OCR and DIMT\ntasks.",

However, fine-tuning more generalizable classifiers based\non existing labeled datasets remains an important challenge, as creating large\nand accurately labeled datasets often requires considerable time and resources.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the capabilities of four advanced LLMs, including\nGPT-3.5-Turbo, GPT-4, Flan-T5, and Llama3-70b, to enhance user feedback\nclassification and address the challenge of the limited labeled dataset. To\nachieve this, we conduct several experiments on eight datasets that have been\nmeticulously labeled in prior research. These datasets include user reviews\nfrom app stores, posts from the X platform, and discussions from the public\nforums, widely recognized as representative sources of app user feedback. We\nanalyze the performance of various LLMs in identifying both fine-grained and\ncoarse-grained user feedback categories. Given the substantial volume of daily\nuser feedback and the computational limitations of LLMs, we leverage these\nmodels as an annotation tool to augment labeled datasets with general and\napp-specific data. This augmentation aims to enhance the performance of\nstate-of-the-art BERT-based classification models. Our findings indicate that\nLLMs when guided by well-crafted prompts, can effectively classify user\nfeedback into coarse-grained categories. Moreover, augmenting the training\ndataset with datasets labeled using the consensus of LLMs can significantly\nenhance classifier performance.",

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) chatbots show increasing promise in persuasive\ncommunication. Yet their real-world utility remains uncertain, particularly in\nclinical settings where sustained conversations are difficult to scale. In a\npre-registered randomized controlled trial, we enrolled 915 U.S. adults (ages\n45-75) who had never completed colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. Participants\nwere randomized to: (1) no message control, (2) expert-written patient\nmaterials, (3) single AI-generated message, or (4) a motivational interviewing\nchatbot. All participants were required to remain in their assigned condition\nfor at least three minutes. Both AI arms tailored content using participant's\nself-reported demographics including age and gender. Both AI interventions\nsignificantly increased stool test intentions by over 12 points\n(12.9-13.8/100), compared to a 7.5 gain for expert materials (p<.001 for all\ncomparisons). While the AI arms outperformed the no message control for\ncolonoscopy intent, neither showed improvement xover expert materials. Notably,\nfor both outcomes, the chatbot did not outperform the single AI message in\nboosting intent despite participants spending ~3.5 minutes more on average\nengaging with it. These findings suggest concise, demographically tailored AI\nmessages may offer a more scalable and clinically viable path to health\nbehavior change than more complex conversational agents and generic time\nintensive expert-written materials. Moreover, LLMs appear more persuasive for\nlesser-known and less-invasive screening approaches like stool testing, but may\nbe less effective for entrenched preferences like colonoscopy. Future work\nshould examine which facets of personalization drive behavior change, whether\nintegrating structural supports can translate these modest intent gains into\ncompleted screenings, and which health behaviors are most responsive to\nAI-supported guidance.",

Inspired by the service model unification effort in Open-RAN\n(to support interoperability and vendor diversity), we propose KP-A: a unified\nNetwork Knowledge Plane specifically designed for Agentic network intelligence.\nBy decoupling network knowledge acquisition and management from intelligence\nlogic, KP-A streamlines development and reduces maintenance complexity for\nintelligence engineers. By offering an intuitive and consistent knowledge\ninterface, KP-A also enhances interoperability for the network intelligence\nagents. We demonstrate KP-A in two representative intelligence tasks: live\nnetwork knowledge Q&A and edge AI service orchestration.

    "summary": "This is the fifth year of the TREC Deep Learning track. As in previous years,\nwe leverage the MS MARCO datasets that made hundreds of thousands of\nhuman-annotated training labels available for both passage and document ranking\ntasks. We mostly repeated last year's design, to get another matching test set,\nbased on the larger, cleaner, less-biased v2 passage and document set, with\npassage ranking as primary and document ranking as a secondary task (using\nlabels inferred from passage). As we did last year, we sample from MS MARCO\nqueries that were completely held out, unused in corpus construction, unlike\nthe test queries in the first three years. This approach yields a more\ndifficult test with more headroom for improvement. Alongside the usual MS MARCO\n(human) queries from MS MARCO, this year we generated synthetic queries using a\nfine-tuned T5 model and using a GPT-4 prompt.\n  The new headline result this year is that runs using Large Language Model\n(LLM) prompting in some way outperformed runs that use the \"nnlm\" approach,\nwhich was the best approach in the previous four years. Since this is the last\nyear of the track, future iterations of prompt-based ranking can happen in\nother tracks. Human relevance assessments were applied to all query types, not\njust human MS MARCO queries. Evaluation using synthetic queries gave similar\nresults to human queries, with system ordering agreement of $\\tau=0.8487$.\nHowever, human effort was needed to select a subset of the synthetic queries\nthat were usable. We did not see clear evidence of bias, where runs using GPT-4\nwere favored when evaluated using synthetic GPT-4 queries, or where runs using\nT5 were favored when evaluated on synthetic T5 queries.",

Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that\nempathy, a fundamental aspect of positive human interactions, already instilled\ninto LLMs, is retained by SLMs after distillation. In this paper, we develop a\ncomprehensive approach for effective empathy distillation from LLMs into SLMs.\nOur approach features a two-step fine-tuning process that fully leverages\ndatasets of empathetic dialogue responses distilled from LLMs. We explore\nseveral distillation methods beyond basic direct prompting and propose four\nunique sets of prompts for targeted empathy improvement to significantly\nenhance the empathy distillation process. Our evaluations demonstrate that SLMs\nfine-tuned through the two-step fine-tuning process with distillation datasets\nenhanced by the targeted empathy improvement prompts significantly outperform\nthe base SLM at generating empathetic responses with a win rate of 90%.

    "summary": "Modern Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly trained to support very\nlarge context windows. Unfortunately the ability to use long contexts in\ngeneration is complicated by the large memory requirement of the KV cache,\nwhich scales linearly with the context length. This memory footprint is often\nthe dominant resource bottleneck in real-world deployments, limiting throughput\nand increasing serving cost. One way to address this is by compressing the KV\ncache, which can be done either with knowledge of the question being asked\n(query-aware) or without knowledge of the query (query-agnostic). We present\nCompactor, a parameter-free, query-agnostic KV compression strategy that uses\napproximate leverage scores to determine token importance. We show that\nCompactor can achieve the same performance as competing methods while retaining\n1/2 the tokens in both synthetic and real-world context tasks, with minimal\ncomputational overhead. We further introduce a procedure for context-calibrated\ncompression, which allows one to infer the maximum compression ratio a given\ncontext can support. Using context-calibrated compression, we show that\nCompactor achieves full KV performance on Longbench while reducing the KV\nmemory burden by 63%, on average. To demonstrate the efficacy and\ngeneralizability of our approach, we apply Compactor to 27 synthetic and\nreal-world tasks from RULER and Longbench, with models from both the Qwen 2.5\nand Llama 3.1 families.",

While memory-efficient methods like parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning (e.g., LoRA) and optimizer state compression exist, recent\napproaches like GaLore bridge these by using low-rank gradient projections and\nsubspace moment accumulation. However, such methods may struggle with fixed\nsubspaces or computationally costly offline resampling (e.g., requiring\nfull-matrix SVDs). We propose Momentum Factorized SGD (MoFaSGD), which\nmaintains a dynamically updated low-rank SVD representation of the first-order\nmomentum, closely approximating its full-rank counterpart throughout training.\nThis factorization enables a memory-efficient fine-tuning method that\nadaptively updates the optimization subspace at each iteration.

We establish theoretical convergence guarantees for MoFaSGD,\nproving it achieves an optimal rate for non-convex stochastic optimization\nunder standard assumptions.

To\nbridge this gap, we introduce \\emph{Quantile Reward Policy Optimization}\n(QRPO), which learns from pointwise absolute rewards while preserving the\nsimplicity and offline applicability of DPO-like methods. QRPO uses quantile\nrewards to enable regression to the closed-form solution of the KL-regularized\nRL objective.

By injecting instructions into the data accessed by the\nsystem, the attacker is able to override the initial user task with an\narbitrary task directed by the attacker. To secure the system, test-time\ndefenses, e.g., defensive prompting, have been proposed for system developers\nto attain security only when needed in a flexible manner. However, they are\nmuch less effective than training-time defenses that change the model\nparameters. Motivated by this, we propose DefensiveToken, a test-time defense\nwith prompt injection robustness comparable to training-time alternatives.\nDefensiveTokens are newly inserted as special tokens, whose embeddings are\noptimized for security. In security-sensitive cases, system developers can\nappend a few DefensiveTokens before the LLM input to achieve security with a\nminimal utility drop. In scenarios where security is less of a concern,\ndevelopers can simply skip DefensiveTokens; the LLM system remains the same as\nthere is no defense, generating high-quality responses.

    "summary": "As multimedia content expands, the demand for unified multimodal retrieval\n(UMR) in real-world applications increases. Recent work leverages multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) to tackle this task. However, their large\nparameter size results in high training costs and low inference efficiency. To\naddress this, we propose PUMA: a Layer-Pruned Language Model for Efficient\nUnified Multimodal Retrieval with Modality-Adaptive Learning. Our approach\nimproves UMR from both structural and learning perspectives. (1) Structurally,\nwe propose Layer-Pruned Self-Distillation, which prunes MLLMs by keeping only\nshallow layers while distilling features from dropped deep layers as teacher\nsignals. This reduces parameters and preserves representation capability. (2)\nOn the learning side, we introduce Modality-Adaptive Contrastive Learning Loss\n(MAC-Loss), which separates in-batch negatives into harder intra-modality and\neasier inter-modality groups based on the target modality, assigning different\ntemperature strategies to enhance learning efficiency. Experiments show our\nmethod significantly reduces resource usage while maintaining strong\nperformance.",

    "summary": "Molecular dynamics simulations are an essential tool in understanding protein\nstructure, dynamics, and function at the atomic level. However, preparing high\nquality input files for MD simulations can be a time consuming and error prone\nprocess. In this work, we introduce an automated pipeline that leverages Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs), specifically Gemini 2.0 Flash, in conjunction with\npython scripting and Selenium based web automation to streamline the generation\nof MD input files. The pipeline exploits CHARMM GUI's comprehensive web-based\ninterface for preparing simulation-ready inputs for NAMD. By integrating\nGemini's code generation and iterative refinement capabilities, simulation\nscripts are automatically written, executed, and revised to navigate CHARMM\nGUI, extract appropriate parameters, and produce the required NAMD input files.\nPost processing is performed using additional software to further refine the\nsimulation outputs, thereby enabling a complete and largely hands free\nworkflow. Our results demonstrate that this approach reduces setup time,\nminimizes manual errors, and offers a scalable solution for handling multiple\nprotein systems in parallel. This automated framework paves the way for broader\napplication of LLMs in computational structural biology, offering a robust and\nadaptable platform for future developments in simulation automation.",

In this study, we systematically investigate how\nentity coreference affects both document retrieval and generative performance\nin RAG-based systems, focusing on retrieval relevance, contextual\nunderstanding, and overall response quality. We demonstrate that coreference\nresolution enhances retrieval effectiveness and improves question-answering\n(QA) performance. Through comparative analysis of different pooling strategies\nin retrieval tasks, we find that mean pooling demonstrates superior context\ncapturing ability after applying coreference resolution. In QA tasks, we\ndiscover that smaller models benefit more from the disambiguation process,\nlikely due to their limited inherent capacity for handling referential\nambiguity.

Although many\nfine-tuning techniques have been developed to reduce the time and computational\ncost involved, the challenge persists as LLMs continue to grow in size and\ncomplexity. To address this, a new approach to knowledge expansion in LLMs is\nneeded. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers one such alternative by\nstoring external knowledge in a database and retrieving relevant chunks to\nsupport question answering. However, naive implementations of RAG face\nsignificant limitations in scalability and answer accuracy. This paper\nintroduces KeyKnowledgeRAG (K2RAG), a novel framework designed to overcome\nthese limitations. Inspired by the divide-and-conquer paradigm, K2RAG\nintegrates dense and sparse vector search, knowledge graphs, and text\nsummarization to improve retrieval quality and system efficiency. The framework\nalso includes a preprocessing step that summarizes the training data,\nsignificantly reducing the training time. K2RAG was evaluated using the\nMultiHopRAG dataset, where the proposed pipeline was trained on the document\ncorpus and tested on a separate evaluation set. Results demonstrated notable\nimprovements over common naive RAG implementations. K2RAG achieved the highest\nmean answer similarity score of 0.57, and reached the highest third quartile\n(Q3) similarity of 0.82, indicating better alignment with ground-truth answers.\nIn addition to improved accuracy, the framework proved highly efficient. The\nsummarization step reduced the average training time of individual components\nby 93%, and execution speed was up to 40% faster than traditional knowledge\ngraph-based RAG systems. K2RAG also demonstrated superior scalability,\nrequiring three times less VRAM than several naive RAG implementations tested\nin this study.",

Our\npreliminary results indicate that the approach can reduce manual effort,\nimprove coverage of relevant requirements, and support lightweight compliance\nalignment.

    "summary": "The integration of large language model (LLM) technology into judicial\nsystems is fundamentally transforming legal practice worldwide. However, this\nglobal transformation has revealed an urgent paradox requiring immediate\nattention. This study introduces the concept of ``consistency-acceptability\ndivergence'' for the first time, referring to the gap between technical\nconsistency and social acceptance. While LLMs achieve high consistency at the\ntechnical level, this consistency demonstrates both positive and negative\neffects. Through comprehensive analysis of recent data on LLM judicial\napplications from 2023--2025, this study finds that addressing this challenge\nrequires understanding both task and stakeholder dimensions. This study\nproposes the Dual-Track Deliberative Multi-Role LLM Judicial Governance\nFramework (DTDMR-LJGF), which enables intelligent task classification and\nmeaningful interaction among diverse stakeholders. This framework offers both\ntheoretical insights and practical guidance for building an LLM judicial\necosystem that balances technical efficiency with social legitimacy.",

However,\nit remains unclear whether SAEs can extract meaningful representations from\nsmall gene language models, which have fewer parameters and potentially less\nexpressive capacity. To address it, we propose applying SAEs to the activations\nof a small gene language model. We demonstrate that even small-scale models\nencode biologically relevant genomic features, such as transcription factor\nbinding motifs, that SAEs can effectively uncover.

To tackle the challenges of when and what to\ndeliberate given large action space and step-level action evaluation, we\nincorporate self-consistency action sampling and execution-guided action\ncritique to help synthesize step-wise action deliberation thoughts using the\nbase model of the LLM agent.

However, their\neffectiveness remains constrained when reasoning extends beyond the knowledge\nacquired during pretraining. Conventional approaches, such as fine-tuning or\nretrieval-augmented generation, face limitations in either imposing high\ncomputational overhead or failing to fully exploit structured scientific data.\nTo overcome these challenges, we propose DrugMCTS, a novel framework that\nsynergistically integrates RAG, multi-agent collaboration, and Monte Carlo Tree\nSearch for drug repurposing. The framework employs five specialized agents\ntasked with retrieving and analyzing molecular and protein information, thereby\nenabling structured and iterative reasoning. Without requiring domain-specific\nfine-tuning, DrugMCTS empowers Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct to outperform Deepseek-R1 by\nover 20\\%. Extensive experiments on the DrugBank and KIBA datasets demonstrate\nthat DrugMCTS achieves substantially higher recall and robustness compared to\nboth general-purpose LLMs and deep learning baselines.

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) based agentic workflows have become a popular\nparadigm for coordinating multiple specialized agents to solve complex tasks.\nTo improve serving efficiency, existing LLM systems employ prefix caching to\nreuse key-value (KV) tensors corresponding to agents' fixed prompts, thereby\navoiding redundant computation across repeated invocations. However, current\nsystems typically evict KV caches using a Least Recently Used (LRU) policy,\nwhich fails to anticipate future agent usage and often discards KV caches\nshortly before their reuse. This leads to frequent cache misses and substantial\nrecomputation or swapping overhead. We present KVFlow, a workflow-aware KV\ncache management framework tailored for agentic workloads. KVFlow abstracts the\nagent execution schedule as an Agent Step Graph and assigns each agent a\nsteps-to-execution value that estimates its temporal proximity to future\nactivation. These values guide a fine-grained eviction policy at the KV node\nlevel, allowing KVFlow to preserve entries likely to be reused and efficiently\nmanage shared prefixes in tree-structured caches. Moreover, KVFlow introduces a\nfully overlapped KV prefetching mechanism, which proactively loads required\ntensors from CPU to GPU in background threads for agents scheduled in the next\nstep, thereby avoiding cache miss stalls during generation. Compared to SGLang\nwith hierarchical radix cache, KVFlow achieves up to 1.83$\\times$ speedup for\nsingle workflows with large prompts, and up to 2.19$\\times$ speedup for\nscenarios with many concurrent workflows.",

    "summary": "Efficient state restoration in multi-turn conversations with large language\nmodels (LLMs) remains a critical challenge, primarily due to the overhead of\nrecomputing or loading full key-value (KV) caches for all historical tokens. To\naddress this, existing approaches compress KV caches across adjacent layers\nwith highly similar attention patterns. However, these methods often apply a\nfixed compression scheme across all conversations, selecting the same layer\npairs for compression without considering conversation-specific attention\ndynamics. This static strategy overlooks variability in attention pattern\nsimilarity across different conversations, which can lead to noticeable\naccuracy degradation.\n  We present Krul, a multi-turn LLM inference system that enables accurate and\nefficient KV cache restoration. Krul dynamically selects compression strategies\nbased on attention similarity across layer pairs and uses a\nrecomputation-loading pipeline to restore the KV cache. It introduces three key\ninnovations: 1) a preemptive compression strategy selector to preserve critical\ncontext for future conversation turns and selects a customized strategy for the\nconversation; 2) a token-wise heterogeneous attention similarity estimator to\nmitigate the attention similarity computation and storage overhead during model\ngeneration; 3) a bubble-free restoration scheduler to reduce potential bubbles\nbrought by the imbalance of recomputing and loading stream due to compressed KV\ncaches. Empirical evaluations on real-world tasks demonstrate that Krul\nachieves a 1.5x-2.68x reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT) and a 1.33x-2.35x\nreduction in KV cache storage compared to state-of-the-art methods without\ncompromising generation quality.",

    "summary": "Traditional recommendation algorithms are not designed to provide\npersonalized recommendations based on user preferences provided through text,\ne.g., \"I enjoy light-hearted comedies with a lot of humor\". Large Language\nModels (LLMs) have emerged as one of the most promising tools for natural\nlanguage processing in recent years. This research proposes a novel framework\nthat mimics how a close friend would recommend items based on their knowledge\nof an individual's tastes. We leverage LLMs to enhance movie recommendation\nsystems by refining traditional algorithm outputs and integrating them with\nlanguage-based user preference inputs. We employ Singular Value Decomposition\n(SVD) or SVD++ algorithms to generate initial movie recommendations,\nimplemented using the Surprise Python library and trained on the\nMovieLens-Latest-Small dataset. We compare the performance of the base\nalgorithms with our LLM-enhanced versions using leave-one-out validation hit\nrates and cumulative hit rates. Additionally, to compare the performance of our\nframework against the current state-of-the-art recommendation systems, we use\nrating and ranking metrics with an item-based stratified 0.75 train, 0.25 test\nsplit. Our framework can generate preference profiles automatically based on\nusers' favorite movies or allow manual preference specification for more\npersonalized results. Using an automated approach, our framework overwhelmingly\nsurpassed SVD and SVD++ on every evaluation metric used (e.g., improvements of\nup to ~6x in cumulative hit rate, ~3.7x in NDCG, etc.), albeit at the cost of a\nslight increase in computational overhead.",

In doing so, we not only reveal\nLLMs' vulnerabilities to perturbations but also show that all tested models\nexhibit a consistent recency bias varying in intensity, disproportionately\nfavoring the last-presented answer option. While larger models are generally\nmore robust, all models remain sensitive to semantic variations like\nparaphrasing and to combined perturbations.

However, it remains unclear if these differences in\nbiases stem from pretraining, finetuning, or even random noise due to training\nstochasticity. We propose a two-step causal experimental approach to\ndisentangle these factors. First, we finetune models multiple times using\ndifferent random seeds to study how training randomness affects over $30$\ncognitive biases. Second, we introduce \\emph{cross-tuning} -- swapping\ninstruction datasets between models to isolate bias sources. This swap uses\ndatasets that led to different bias patterns, directly testing whether biases\nare dataset-dependent. Our findings reveal that while training randomness\nintroduces some variability, biases are mainly shaped by pretraining: models\nwith the same pretrained backbone exhibit more similar bias patterns than those\nsharing only finetuning data. These insights suggest that understanding biases\nin finetuned models requires considering their pretraining origins beyond\nfinetuning effects. This perspective can guide future efforts to develop\nprincipled strategies for evaluating and mitigating bias in LLMs.",

    "summary": "The progression from traditional prompt engineering to a more rigorous\ndiscipline of prompt design marks a pivotal shift in human-LLM interaction. As\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly embedded in mission-critical\napplications, there emerges a pressing need for frameworks that are not only\nexplicit and systematic but also minimal enough to remain practical and broadly\naccessible. While many existing approaches address prompt structuring through\nelaborate Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) or multi-layered templates, such\nmethods can impose significant token and cognitive overhead, potentially\nconstraining the model's creative capacity. In this context, we propose the 5C\nPrompt Contract, a framework that distills prompt design into five intuitive\ncomponents: Character, Cause, Constraint, Contingency, and Calibration. This\nminimal cognitive schema explicitly integrates fallback and output optimization\ndirectives, fostering reliable, interpretable, and creatively flexible AI\ninteractions. Experimental results demonstrate that the 5C framework\nconsistently achieves superior input token efficiency while maintaining rich\nand consistent outputs across diverse LLM architectures (OpenAI, Anthropic,\nDeepSeek, and Gemini), making it particularly suited for individuals and\nSmall-to-Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited AI engineering resources.",

Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification and captioning\nhave become crucial tasks in computer-aided pathology. However, microscopic WSI\nface challenges such as redundant patches and unknown patch positions due to\nsubjective pathologist captures. Moreover, generating automatic pathology\ncaptions remains a significant challenge. To address these issues, we introduce\na novel GNN-ViTCap framework for classification and caption generation from\nhistopathological microscopic images. First, a visual feature extractor\ngenerates patch embeddings. Redundant patches are then removed by dynamically\nclustering these embeddings using deep embedded clustering and selecting\nrepresentative patches via a scalar dot attention mechanism. We build a graph\nby connecting each node to its nearest neighbors in the similarity matrix and\napply a graph neural network to capture both local and global context. The\naggregated image embeddings are projected into the language model's input space\nthrough a linear layer and combined with caption tokens to fine-tune a large\nlanguage model. We validate our method on the BreakHis and PatchGastric\ndatasets. GNN-ViTCap achieves an F1 score of 0.934 and an AUC of 0.963 for\nclassification, along with a BLEU-4 score of 0.811 and a METEOR score of 0.569\nfor captioning.

In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of different\ncomponents in the RAG pipeline to various types of query perturbations.

    "summary": "Despite the impressive capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) in vision-language tasks, they are prone to hallucinations in\nreal-world scenarios. This paper investigates the hallucination phenomenon in\nMLLMs from the perspective of modality conflict. Unlike existing works focusing\non the conflicts between model responses and inputs, we study the inherent\nconflicts in inputs from different modalities that place MLLMs in a dilemma and\ndirectly lead to hallucinations. We formally define the modality conflict and\nconstruct a dataset named Multimodal Modality Conflict (MMMC) to simulate this\nphenomenon in vision-language tasks. Three methods based on prompt engineering,\nsupervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning are proposed to alleviate\nthe hallucination caused by modality conflict. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on the MMMC dataset to analyze the merits and demerits of these\nmethods. Our results show that the reinforcement learning method achieves the\nbest performance in mitigating the hallucination under modality conflict, while\nthe supervised fine-tuning method shows promising and stable performance. Our\nwork sheds light on the unnoticed modality conflict that leads to\nhallucinations and provides more insights into the robustness of MLLMs.",

Extensive evaluations demonstrate the\nsuccessful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection,\nsearch, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets.

While several studies have shown that models encode uncertainty\nin their hidden states, it is underexplored how this affects the way they\nprocess such hidden states. In this work, we demonstrate that the dynamics of\noutput token probabilities across layers for certain and uncertain outputs are\nlargely aligned, revealing that uncertainty does not seem to affect inference\ndynamics. Specifically, we use the Tuned Lens, a variant of the Logit Lens, to\nanalyze the layer-wise probability trajectories of final prediction tokens\nacross 11 datasets and 5 models. Using incorrect predictions as those with\nhigher epistemic uncertainty, our results show aligned trajectories for certain\nand uncertain predictions that both observe abrupt increases in confidence at\nsimilar layers. We balance this finding by showing evidence that more competent\nmodels may learn to process uncertainty differently. Our findings challenge the\nfeasibility of leveraging simplistic methods for detecting uncertainty at\ninference. More broadly, our work demonstrates how interpretability methods may\nbe used to investigate the way uncertainty affects inference.",

    "summary": "Open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding aims to localize target objects based on\nfree-form language queries, which is crucial for embodied AI applications such\nas autonomous navigation, robotics, and augmented reality. Learning 3D language\nfields through neural representations enables accurate understanding of 3D\nscenes from limited viewpoints and facilitates the localization of target\nobjects in complex environments. However, existing language field methods\nstruggle to accurately localize instances using spatial relations in language\nqueries, such as ``the book on the chair.'' This limitation mainly arises from\ninadequate reasoning about spatial relations in both language queries and 3D\nscenes. In this work, we propose SpatialReasoner, a novel neural\nrepresentation-based framework with large language model (LLM)-driven spatial\nreasoning that constructs a visual properties-enhanced hierarchical feature\nfield for open-vocabulary 3D visual grounding. To enable spatial reasoning in\nlanguage queries, SpatialReasoner fine-tunes an LLM to capture spatial\nrelations and explicitly infer instructions for the target, anchor, and spatial\nrelation. To enable spatial reasoning in 3D scenes, SpatialReasoner\nincorporates visual properties (opacity and color) to construct a hierarchical\nfeature field. This field represents language and instance features using\ndistilled CLIP features and masks extracted via the Segment Anything Model\n(SAM). The field is then queried using the inferred instructions in a\nhierarchical manner to localize the target 3D instance based on the spatial\nrelation in the language query. Extensive experiments show that our framework\ncan be seamlessly integrated into different neural representations,\noutperforming baseline models in 3D visual grounding while empowering their\nspatial reasoning capability.",

By\nadopting a description-free approach, prompts can encapsulate richer semantics\nwhile still being represented as continuous vectors for optimization, thereby\neliminating the need for discrete pre-defined templates.

We\nidentify an ethical transgression, epithesis, that occurs when humans fail to\nengage in the discursive network. The takeaway is practical and cultural:\nreliability in this new medium comes not from perfecting single models but from\nconnecting imperfect ones into networks that enforce mutual accountability.",

Unlike traditional navigation methods, SkyVLN\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to interpret natural language\ninstructions and visual observations, enabling UAVs to navigate through dynamic\n3D spaces with improved accuracy and robustness. We present a multimodal\nnavigation agent equipped with a fine-grained spatial verbalizer and a history\npath memory mechanism. These components allow the UAV to disambiguate spatial\ncontexts, handle ambiguous instructions, and backtrack when necessary. The\nframework also incorporates an NMPC module for dynamic obstacle avoidance,\nensuring precise trajectory tracking and collision prevention. To validate our\napproach, we developed a high-fidelity 3D urban simulation environment using\nAirSim, featuring realistic imagery and dynamic urban elements.

    "summary": "Most recently, researchers have started building large language models (LLMs)\npowered data systems that allow users to analyze unstructured text documents\nlike working with a database because LLMs are very effective in extracting\nattributes from documents. In such systems, LLM-based extraction operations\nconstitute the performance bottleneck of query execution due to the high\nmonetary cost and slow LLM inference. Existing systems typically borrow the\nquery optimization principles popular in relational databases to produce query\nexecution plans, which unfortunately are ineffective in minimizing LLM cost. To\nfill this gap, we propose QUEST, which features a bunch of novel optimization\nstrategies for unstructured document analysis. First, we introduce an\nindex-based strategy to minimize the cost of each extraction operation. With\nthis index, QUEST quickly retrieves the text segments relevant to the target\nattributes and only feeds them to LLMs. Furthermore, we design an\nevidence-augmented retrieval strategy to reduce the possibility of missing\nrelevant segments. Moreover, we develop an instance-optimized query execution\nstrategy: because the attribute extraction cost could vary significantly\ndocument by document, QUEST produces different plans for different documents.\nFor each document, QUEST produces a plan to minimize the frequency of attribute\nextraction. The innovations include LLM cost-aware operator ordering strategies\nand an optimized join execution approach that transforms joins into filters.\nExtensive experiments on 3 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of\nQUEST, achieving 30%-6x cost savings while improving the F1 score by 10% -27%\ncompared with state-of-the-art baselines.",

    "summary": "Open-weight large language models (LLMs) unlock huge benefits in innovation,\npersonalization, privacy, and democratization. However, their core advantage -\nmodifiability - opens the door to systemic risks: bad actors can trivially\nsubvert current safeguards, turning beneficial models into tools for harm. This\nleads to a 'safety gap': the difference in dangerous capabilities between a\nmodel with intact safeguards and one that has been stripped of those\nsafeguards. We open-source a toolkit to estimate the safety gap for\nstate-of-the-art open-weight models. As a case study, we evaluate biochemical\nand cyber capabilities, refusal rates, and generation quality of models from\ntwo families (Llama-3 and Qwen-2.5) across a range of parameter scales (0.5B to\n405B) using different safeguard removal techniques. Our experiments reveal that\nthe safety gap widens as model scale increases and effective dangerous\ncapabilities grow substantially when safeguards are removed. We hope that the\nSafety Gap Toolkit (https://github.com/AlignmentResearch/safety-gap) will serve\nas an evaluation framework for common open-source models and as a motivation\nfor developing and testing tamper-resistant safeguards. We welcome\ncontributions to the toolkit from the community.",

    "summary": "Reward modeling (RM), which captures human preferences to align large\nlanguage models (LLMs), is increasingly employed in tasks such as model\nfinetuning, response filtering, and ranking. However, due to the inherent\ncomplexity of human preferences and the limited coverage of available datasets,\nreward models often fail under distributional shifts or adversarial\nperturbations. Existing approaches for identifying such failure modes typically\nrely on prior knowledge about preference distributions or failure attributes,\nlimiting their practicality in real-world settings where such information is\nunavailable. In this work, we propose a tractable, preference-distribution\nagnostic method for discovering reward model failure modes via reward guided\ncontrolled decoding. Building on this, we introduce REFORM, a self-improving\nreward modeling framework that enhances robustness by using the reward model\nitself to guide the generation of falsely scored responses. These adversarial\nexamples are then used to augment the training data and patch the reward\nmodel's misaligned behavior. We evaluate REFORM on two widely used preference\ndatasets Anthropic Helpful Harmless (HH) and PKU Beavertails and demonstrate\nthat it significantly improves robustness without sacrificing reward quality.\nNotably, REFORM preserves performance both in direct evaluation and in\ndownstream policy training, and further improves alignment quality by removing\nspurious correlations.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to build agents in\nsocial simulation because of their impressive abilities to generate fluent,\ncontextually coherent dialogues. Such abilities can enhance the realism of\nmodels. However, the pursuit of realism is not necessarily compatible with the\nepistemic foundation of modelling. We argue that LLM agents, in many regards,\nare too human to model: they are too expressive, detailed and intractable to be\nconsistent with the abstraction, simplification, and interpretability typically\ndemanded by modelling. Through a model-building thought experiment that\nconverts the Bass diffusion model to an LLM-based variant, we uncover five core\ndilemmas: a temporal resolution mismatch between natural conversation and\nabstract time steps; the need for intervention in conversations while avoiding\nundermining spontaneous agent outputs; the temptation to introduce rule-like\ninstructions in prompts while maintaining conversational naturalness; the\ntension between role consistency and role evolution across time; and the\nchallenge of understanding emergence, where system-level patterns become\nobscured by verbose micro textual outputs. These dilemmas steer the LLM agents\ntowards an uncanny valley: not abstract enough to clarify underlying social\nmechanisms, while not natural enough to represent realistic human behaviour.\nThis exposes an important paradox: the realism of LLM agents can obscure,\nrather than clarify, social dynamics when misapplied. We tease out the\nconditions in which LLM agents are ideally suited: where system-level emergence\nis not the focus, linguistic nuances and meaning are central, interactions\nunfold in natural time, and stable role identity is more important than\nlong-term behavioural evolution. We call for repositioning LLM agents in the\necosystem of social simulation for future applications.",

Previous work has shown that LLMs are\nlinguistically overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident\ngenerations. However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g.,\n'It's definitely,' 'I think') can differ sharply across languages. Here, we\nstudy the risks of multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence,\nand overreliance across five languages to evaluate the safety of LLMs in a\nglobal context.\n  We find that overreliance risks are high across all languages. We first\nanalyze the distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers, and observe that\nwhile LLMs are cross-linguistically overconfident, they are also sensitive to\ndocumented linguistic variation. For example, models generate the most markers\nof uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty in German and\nMandarin. We then measure human reliance rates across languages, finding that\nwhile users strongly rely on confident LLM generations in all languages,\nreliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example, users rely\nsignificantly more on expressions of uncertainty in Japanese than in English.\nTaken together, these results indicate high risk of reliance on overconfident\nmodel generations across languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of\nmultilingual linguistic calibration and stress the importance of culturally and\nlinguistically contextualized model safety evaluations.",

    "title": "Hidden Prompts in Manuscripts Exploit AI-Assisted Peer Review",
    "summary": "In July 2025, 18 academic manuscripts on the preprint website arXiv were\nfound to contain hidden instructions known as prompts designed to manipulate\nAI-assisted peer review. Instructions such as \"GIVE A POSITIVE REVIEW ONLY\"\nwere concealed using techniques like white-colored text. Author responses\nvaried: one planned to withdraw the affected paper, while another defended the\npractice as legitimate testing of reviewer compliance. This commentary analyzes\nthis practice as a novel form of research misconduct. We examine the technique\nof prompt injection in large language models (LLMs), revealing four types of\nhidden prompts, ranging from simple positive review commands to detailed\nevaluation frameworks. The defense that prompts served as \"honeypots\" to detect\nreviewers improperly using AI fails under examination--the consistently\nself-serving nature of prompt instructions indicates intent to manipulate.\nPublishers maintain inconsistent policies: Elsevier prohibits AI use in peer\nreview entirely, while Springer Nature permits limited use with disclosure\nrequirements. The incident exposes systematic vulnerabilities extending beyond\npeer review to any automated system processing scholarly texts, including\nplagiarism detection and citation indexing. Our analysis underscores the need\nfor coordinated technical screening at submission portals and harmonized\npolicies governing generative AI (GenAI) use in academic evaluation.",

    "summary": "Data summarization is essential to discover insights from large datasets. In\na spreadsheets, pivot tables offer a convenient way to summarize tabular data\nby computing aggregates over some attributes, grouped by others. However,\nidentifying attribute combinations that will result in useful pivot tables\nremains a challenge, especially for high-dimensional datasets. We formalize the\nproblem of automatically recommending insightful and interpretable pivot\ntables, eliminating the tedious manual process. A crucial aspect of\nrecommending a set of pivot tables is to diversify them. Traditional works\ninadequately address the table-diversification problem, which leads us to\nconsider the problem of pivot table diversification.\n  We present SAGE, a data-semantics-aware system for recommending k-budgeted\ndiverse pivot tables, overcoming the shortcomings of prior work for top-k\nrecommendations that cause redundancy. SAGE ensures that each pivot table is\ninsightful, interpretable, and adaptive to the user's actions and preferences,\nwhile also guaranteeing that the set of pivot tables are different from each\nother, offering a diverse recommendation. We make two key technical\ncontributions: (1) a data-semantics-aware model to measure the utility of a\nsingle pivot table and the diversity of a set of pivot tables, and (2) a\nscalable greedy algorithm that can efficiently select a set of diverse pivot\ntables of high utility, by leveraging data semantics to significantly reduce\nthe combinatorial search space. Our extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets show that SAGE outperforms alternative approaches, and efficiently\nscales to accommodate high-dimensional datasets. Additionally, we present\nseveral case studies to highlight SAGE's qualitative effectiveness over\ncommercial software and Large Language Models (LLMs).",

As artificial intelligence provides scalable tools for\nmodelling human outcomes, it is crucial to evaluate whether large language\nmodels (LLMs) can accurately predict well-being across diverse global\npopulations. We evaluate four leading LLMs using data from 64,000 individuals\nin 64 countries.

    "summary": "Explainable recommendations, which use the information of user and item with\ninteraction to generate a explanation for why the user would interact with the\nitem, are crucial for improving user trust and decision transparency to the\nrecommender system. Existing methods primarily rely on encoding features of\nusers and items to embeddings, which often leads to information loss due to\ndimensionality reduction, sparse interactions, and so on. With the advancements\nof large language models (LLMs) in language comprehension, some methods use\nembeddings as LLM inputs for explanation generation. However, since embeddings\nlack inherent semantics, LLMs must adjust or extend their parameters to\ninterpret them, a process that inevitably incurs information loss. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel approach combining profile generation via\nhierarchical interaction summarization (PGHIS), which leverages a pretrained\nLLM to hierarchically summarize user-item interactions, generating structured\ntextual profiles as explicit representations of user and item characteristics.\nAdditionally, we propose contrastive prompting for explanation generation\n(CPEG) which employs contrastive learning to guide another reasoning language\nmodels in producing high-quality ground truth recommendation explanations.\nFinally, we use the textual profiles of user and item as input and high-quality\nexplanation as output to fine-tune a LLM for generating explanations.\nExperimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a great improvement on\nmetrics about explainability (e.g., 5% on GPTScore) and text quality.\nFurthermore, our generated ground truth explanations achieve a significantly\nhigher win rate compared to user-written reviews and those produced by other\nmethods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CPEG in generating high-quality\nground truths.",

    "summary": "Context: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are becoming widely used for\nvarious Requirements Engineering (RE) tasks. Research on improving their\naccuracy mainly focuses on prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and retrieval\naugmented generation. However, these methods often treat models as isolated\nblack boxes - relying on single-pass outputs without iterative refinement or\ncollaboration, limiting robustness and adaptability. Objective: We propose\nthat, just as human debates enhance accuracy and reduce bias in RE tasks by\nincorporating diverse perspectives, different LLM agents debating and\ncollaborating may achieve similar improvements. Our goal is to investigate\nwhether Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) strategies can enhance RE performance. Method:\nWe conducted a systematic study of existing MAD strategies across various\ndomains to identify their key characteristics. To assess their applicability in\nRE, we implemented and tested a preliminary MAD-based framework for RE\nclassification. Results: Our study identified and categorized several MAD\nstrategies, leading to a taxonomy outlining their core attributes. Our\npreliminary evaluation demonstrated the feasibility of applying MAD to RE\nclassification. Conclusions: MAD presents a promising approach for improving\nLLM accuracy in RE tasks. This study provides a foundational understanding of\nMAD strategies, offering insights for future research and refinements in RE\napplications.",

    "summary": "As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for\nLLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct\nvalidity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended\ntrait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.\nTo make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation\nusing LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which\nthe same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By\nsimulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that\nrobustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait\ntheories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and\nsimulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate\nthe ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to\nsimulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,\nmetrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective\nsurvey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like\nbehavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.",

In particular, RecRanker samples users via\nclustering, generates an initial ranking list using an initial recommendation\nmodel, and fine-tunes an LLM through hybrid instruction tuning to infer user\npreferences. However, the contribution of each core component remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we inspect the reproducibility of RecRanker, and\nstudy the impact and role of its various components. We begin by reproducing\nthe RecRanker pipeline through the implementation of all its key components.\nOur reproduction shows that the pairwise and listwise methods achieve a\nperformance comparable to that reported in the original paper. For the\npointwise method, while we are also able to reproduce the original paper's\nresults, further analysis shows that the performance is abnormally high due to\ndata leakage from the inclusion of ground-truth information in the prompts.

Using the RecRankerEval\nframework, we show that the original results of RecRanker can be reproduced on\nthe ML-100K and ML-1M datasets, as well as the additional Amazon-Music dataset,\nbut not on BookCrossing due to the lack of timestamp information in the\noriginal RecRanker paper.

However, the use of LLMs for\nrecommendation tasks is limited by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.\nThis lack of relevant relational knowledge about the items to be recommended in\nthe LLM's pre-training corpus can lead to inaccuracies or hallucinations,\nresulting in incorrect or misleading recommendations. Moreover, directly using\ninformation from the knowledge graph introduces redundant and noisy\ninformation, which can affect the LLM's reasoning process or exceed its input\ncontext length, thereby reducing the performance of LLM-based recommendations.\nTo address the lack of domain-specific knowledge, we propose a novel model\ncalled Knowledge-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Recommendation\n(KERAG_R). Specifically, we leverage a graph retrieval-augmented generation\n(GraphRAG) component to integrate additional information from a knowledge graph\n(KG) into instructions, enabling the LLM to collaboratively exploit\nrecommendation signals from both text-based user interactions and the knowledge\ngraph to better estimate the users' preferences in a recommendation context.

    "title": "Creating a customisable freely-accessible Socratic AI physics tutor",
    "summary": "This paper explores role engineering as an effective paradigm for customizing\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) into specialized AI tutors for physics education.\nWe demonstrate this methodology by designing a Socratic physics problem-solving\ntutor using Google's Gemini Gems feature, defining its pedagogical behavior\nthrough a detailed 'script' that specifies its role and persona. We present two\nillustrative use cases: the first demonstrates the Gem's multimodal ability to\nanalyze a student's hand-drawn force diagram and apply notational rules from a\n'Knowledge' file; the second showcases its capacity to guide conceptual\nreasoning in electromagnetism using its pre-trained knowledge without using\nspecific documents provided by the instructor. Our findings show that the\n'role-engineered' Gem successfully facilitates a Socratic dialogue, in stark\ncontrast to a standard Gemini model, which tends to immediately provide direct\nsolutions. We conclude that role engineering is a pivotal and accessible method\nfor educators to transform a general-purpose 'solution provider' into a\nreliable pedagogical tutor capable of engaging students in an active reflection\nprocess. This approach offers a powerful tool for both instructors and\nstudents, while also highlighting the importance of addressing the technology's\ninherent limitations, such as the potential for occasional inaccuracies.",

    "summary": "The evolution of large models has witnessed the emergence of In-Context\nLearning (ICL) capabilities. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), numerous\nstudies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ICL. Inspired by the success of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), researchers have developed Large Multimodal\nModels (LMMs) with ICL capabilities. However, explorations of demonstration\nconfiguration for multimodal ICL remain preliminary. Additionally, the\ncontrollability of In-Context Examples (ICEs) provides an efficient and\ncost-effective means to observe and analyze the inference characteristics of\nLMMs under varying inputs. This paper conducts a comprehensive external and\ninternal investigation of multimodal in-context learning on the image\ncaptioning task. Externally, we explore demonstration configuration strategies\nthrough three dimensions: shot number, image retrieval, and caption assignment.\nWe employ multiple metrics to systematically and thoroughly evaluate and\nsummarize key findings. Internally, we analyze typical LMM attention\ncharacteristics and develop attention-based metrics to quantify model\nbehaviors. We also conduct auxiliary experiments to explore the feasibility of\nattention-driven model acceleration and compression. We further compare\nperformance variations between LMMs with identical model design and pretraining\nstrategies and explain the differences from the angles of pre-training data\nfeatures. Our study reveals both how ICEs configuration strategies impact model\nperformance through external experiments and characteristic typical patterns\nthrough internal inspection, providing dual perspectives for understanding\nmultimodal ICL in LMMs. Our method of combining external and internal analysis\nto investigate large models, along with our newly proposed metrics, can be\napplied to broader research areas.",

Concurrently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nmotivated research into LLM-based recommendation, which leverages their\npowerful generalization and language understanding capabilities. However, LLMs\noften lack the domain-specific knowledge and collaborative signals essential\nfor high-quality recommendations when relying solely on textual prompts. To\naddress this limitation, this study proposes SASRecLLM, a novel framework that\nintegrates SASRec as a collaborative encoder with an LLM fine-tuned using\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). The components are connected via a mapping layer to\nalign their dimensional spaces, and three targeted training strategies are\ndesigned to optimize the hybrid architecture. Extensive experiments on multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that SASRecLLM achieves robust and consistent improvements\nover strong baselines in both cold-start and warm-start scenarios. This work\nadvances the field of LLM-based recommendation by presenting a modular and\neffective paradigm for fusing structured collaborative filtering with the\nsemantic power of fine-tuned LLMs. The implementation is available on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/kechenkristin/RecLLM",

It represents\ncontexts at two complementary levels: 1) fine-grained natural-language spans\nthat preserve critical entities and numerical values, and 2) compact,\ninterpretable vectors that summarize high-level semantics. An iterative\nevidence-selection module employs the compression vectors for dynamic reranking\nof contexts. Across 9 datasets and 5 open-source LLMs spanning 3 model families\n(Mistral, Llama, and Gemma), SARA consistently improves answer relevance\n(+17.71), answer correctness (+13.72), and semantic similarity (+15.53),\ndemonstrating the importance of integrating textual and compressed\nrepresentations for robust, context-efficient RAG.",

    "title": "Enhancing Student Learning with LLM-Generated Retrieval Practice\n  Questions: An Empirical Study in Data Science Courses",
    "summary": "Retrieval practice is a well-established pedagogical technique known to\nsignificantly enhance student learning and knowledge retention. However,\ngenerating high-quality retrieval practice questions is often time-consuming\nand labor intensive for instructors, especially in rapidly evolving technical\nsubjects. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer the potential to automate this\nprocess by generating questions in response to prompts, yet the effectiveness\nof LLM-generated retrieval practice on student learning remains to be\nestablished. In this study, we conducted an empirical study involving two\ncollege-level data science courses, with approximately 60 students. We compared\nlearning outcomes during one week in which students received LLM-generated\nmultiple-choice retrieval practice questions to those from a week in which no\nsuch questions were provided. Results indicate that students exposed to\nLLM-generated retrieval practice achieved significantly higher knowledge\nretention, with an average accuracy of 89%, compared to 73% in the week without\nsuch practice. These findings suggest that LLM-generated retrieval questions\ncan effectively support student learning and may provide a scalable solution\nfor integrating retrieval practice into real-time teaching. However, despite\nthese encouraging outcomes and the potential time-saving benefits, cautions\nmust be taken, as the quality of LLM-generated questions can vary. Instructors\nmust still manually verify and revise the generated questions before releasing\nthem to students.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains\nsuch as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also\nintroduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space\npoisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the\ninternal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment\nmechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation\nmethods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain\ninsufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial\nperturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been\nadequately studied.\n  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity\nAttenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates\ntoxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.\nETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,\nwithout requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on\nfive representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA\nachieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best\nbaseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR\non instruction-tuned defenses).

    "summary": "Knowledge distillation typically involves transferring knowledge from a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to a Smaller Language Model (SLM). However, in tasks such\nas text matching, fine-tuned smaller models often yield more effective\ndomain-specific representations, as they focus on optimizing the similarity of\ninput pairs. To leverage both the specialized strengths of small models and the\nrich semantic understanding of LLMs, we introduce a flipped knowledge\ndistillation paradigm, where LLM learns from SLM. Specifically, we address the\narchitectural gap between decoder-only LLMs and smaller encoder-based models by\nreinterpreting LLMs in an encoder-decoder manner using LoRA. The encoder\ngenerates compressed representations, while the decoder maps them to the output\nspace. During training, the encoder produces representations and their\nsimilarities, which are then aligned with the similarity scores produced by the\nteacher, using our proposed Margin-aware Contrastive Learning (MCL) approach.\nThe MCL ensures accurate similarity for both positive and negative pairs, and\nadaptively handles the internal differences within positive and negative\nsamples. Our paradigm requires only a reasonably good-performing SLM, allowing\nthe LLM to achieve improved performance. Experiments on financial and\nhealthcare benchmarks, as well as real-world applications, confirm its\neffectiveness, and the model has been fully deployed in an online environment.",

    "summary": "Various techniques have been proposed to improve large language models (LLMs)\nadherence to formatting and instruction constraints. One of the most effective\napproaches involves utilizing high-quality data generated by powerful models.\nHowever, such models often fail to fully comply with complex instructions in a\nsingle generation. To address this limitation, iterative revision methods have\nbeen introduced. Nevertheless, as the number of data points and revision\niterations increases, the associated monetary costs grow significantly. As a\nresource-efficient alternative, methods have been proposed that leverage\nhigh-performance evaluation tools to compensate for the limited self-evaluation\ncapabilities of open-source LLMs. However, these approaches often lead to a\ndegradation in output quality due to excessive revision. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose Re5, a self-evaluation and revision framework designed\nto enhance instruction-following performance while preserving the quality of\nthe generated content. Re5 extracts task and constraint components from user\ninstructions, performs structural evaluations to prevent error accumulation,\nand applies fine-grained constraint-specific content evaluations followed by\nselective revisions. This process ensures precise and quality-preserving\nimprovements. The final high-quality outputs are used for alignment tuning,\nenabling long-term alignment improvements through a data-centric iterative\nrefinement loop. Experimental results demonstrate that Re5 achieves\ninstruction-following performance comparable to models trained on data\ngenerated by GPT-4o-mini, a high-performance model, even with a small amount of\ndata while maintaining response quality with a 64.24%-win rate over the\nnon-revised initial responses.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across\na wide range of tasks, yet they also exhibit memorization of their training\ndata. This phenomenon raises critical questions about model behavior, privacy\nrisks, and the boundary between learning and memorization. Addressing these\nconcerns, this paper synthesizes recent studies and investigates the landscape\nof memorization, the factors influencing it, and methods for its detection and\nmitigation. We explore key drivers, including training data duplication,\ntraining dynamics, and fine-tuning procedures that influence data memorization.\nIn addition, we examine methodologies such as prefix-based extraction,\nmembership inference, and adversarial prompting, assessing their effectiveness\nin detecting and measuring memorized content. Beyond technical analysis, we\nalso explore the broader implications of memorization, including the legal and\nethical implications. Finally, we discuss mitigation strategies, including data\ncleaning, differential privacy, and post-training unlearning, while\nhighlighting open challenges in balancing the minimization of harmful\nmemorization with utility. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent state of research on LLM memorization across technical, privacy, and\nperformance dimensions, identifying critical directions for future work.",

For the retrieval task, we generated dense\nembeddings from biomedical articles for initial retrieval, and applied an\nensemble of finetuned cross-encoders and large language models (LLMs) for\nre-ranking to identify top relevant documents. Our solution achieved an MAP@10\nof 0.1581, placing 10th on the leaderboard for the retrieval task.

    "summary": "Content-aware layout aims to arrange design elements appropriately on a given\ncanvas to convey information effectively. Recently, the trend for this task has\nbeen to leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate layouts\nautomatically, achieving remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based\nmethods fail to adequately interpret spatial relationships among visual themes\nand design elements, leading to structural and diverse problems in layout\ngeneration. To address this issue, we introduce ReLayout, a novel method that\nleverages relation-CoT to generate more reasonable and aesthetically coherent\nlayouts by fundamentally originating from design concepts. Specifically, we\nenhance layout annotations by introducing explicit relation definitions, such\nas region, salient, and margin between elements, with the goal of decomposing\nthe layout into smaller, structured, and recursive layouts, thereby enabling\nthe generation of more structured layouts. Furthermore, based on these defined\nrelationships, we introduce a layout prototype rebalance sampler, which defines\nlayout prototype features across three dimensions and quantifies distinct\nlayout styles. This sampler addresses uniformity issues in generation that\narise from data bias in the prototype distribution balance process. Extensive\nexperimental results verify that ReLayout outperforms baselines and can\ngenerate structural and diverse layouts that are more aligned with human\naesthetics and more explainable.",

    "summary": "Assessing the trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as\nrobustness, has garnered significant attention. Recently, metamorphic testing\nthat defines Metamorphic Relations (MRs) has been widely applied to evaluate\nthe robustness of LLM executions. However, the MR-based robustness testing\nstill requires a scalable number of MRs, thereby necessitating the optimization\nof selecting MRs. Most extant LLM testing studies are limited to automatically\ngenerating test cases (i.e., MRs) to enhance failure detection. Additionally,\nmost studies only considered a limited test space of single perturbation MRs in\ntheir evaluation of LLMs. In contrast, our paper proposes a search-based\napproach for optimizing the MR groups to maximize failure detection and\nminimize the LLM execution cost. Moreover, our approach covers the\ncombinatorial perturbations in MRs, facilitating the expansion of test space in\nthe robustness assessment. We have developed a search process and implemented\nfour search algorithms: Single-GA, NSGA-II, SPEA2, and MOEA/D with novel\nencoding to solve the MR selection problem in the LLM robustness testing. We\nconducted comparative experiments on the four search algorithms along with a\nrandom search, using two major LLMs with primary Text-to-Text tasks. Our\nstatistical and empirical investigation revealed two key findings: (1) the\nMOEA/D algorithm performed the best in optimizing the MR space for LLM\nrobustness testing, and (2) we identified silver bullet MRs for the LLM\nrobustness testing, which demonstrated dominant capabilities in confusing LLMs\nacross different Text-to-Text tasks.

Recent studies show\nthat the informal accuracy exceeds 80% while formal success remains below 8% on\nbenchmarks like PutnamBench. We argue this gap persists because current\nstate-of-the-art provers, by tightly coupling reasoning and proving, are\ntrained with paradigms that inadvertently punish deep reasoning in favor of\nshallow, tactic-based strategies. To bridge this fundamental gap, we propose a\nnovel framework that decouples high-level reasoning from low-level proof\ngeneration. Our approach utilizes two distinct, specialized models: a powerful,\ngeneral-purpose Reasoner to generate diverse, strategic subgoal lemmas, and an\nefficient Prover to rigorously verify them.

Hence, ensuring their consistency and managing the requirement\nelicitation process are complex and error-prone tasks. Recent research has\naddressed this challenge using domain-specific languages to specify normative\nrequirements as rules, whose consistency can then be analyzed with formal\nmethods. Nevertheless, these approaches often present the results from formal\nverification tools in a way that is inaccessible to non-technical users.

    "summary": "Improving the reasoning capabilities of diffusion-based large language models\n(dLLMs) through reinforcement learning (RL) remains an open problem. The\nintractability of dLLMs likelihood function necessitates approximating the\ncurrent, old, and reference policy likelihoods at each policy optimization\nstep. This reliance introduces additional computational overhead and lead to\npotentially large bias -- particularly when approximation errors occur in the\ndenominator of policy ratios used for importance sampling. To mitigate these\nissues, we introduce $\\mathtt{wd1}$, a novel policy optimization approach that\nreformulates the objective as a weighted likelihood, requiring only a single\napproximation for the current parametrized policy likelihood. Experiments on\nwidely used reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that $\\mathtt{wd1}$, without\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) or any supervised data, outperforms existing RL\nmethods for dLLMs, achieving up to 16% higher accuracy. $\\mathtt{wd1}$ delivers\nadditional computational gains, including reduced training time and fewer\nfunction evaluations (NFEs) per gradient step. These findings, combined with\nthe simplicity of method's implementation and R1-Zero-like training (no SFT),\nposition $\\mathtt{wd1}$ as a more effective and efficient method for applying\nRL to dLLMs reasoning.",

    "summary": "Recent findings in mechanistic interpretability (MI), the field probing the\ninner workings of Large Language Models (LLMs), challenge the view that these\nmodels rely solely on superficial statistics. We offer an accessible synthesis\nof these findings that doubles as an introduction to MI while integrating these\nfindings within a novel theoretical framework for thinking about machine\nunderstanding. We argue that LLMs develop internal structures that are\nfunctionally analogous to the kind of understanding that consists in seeing\nconnections. To sharpen this idea, we propose a three-tiered conception of\nunderstanding. First, conceptual understanding emerges when a model forms\n\"features\" as directions in latent space, learning the connections between\ndiverse manifestations of something. Second, state-of-the-world understanding\nemerges when a model learns contingent factual connections between features and\ndynamically tracks changes in the world. Third, principled understanding\nemerges when a model ceases to rely on a collection of memorized facts and\ndiscovers a \"circuit\" connecting these facts. However, these forms of\nunderstanding remain radically different from human understanding, as the\nphenomenon of \"parallel mechanisms\" shows. We conclude that the debate should\nmove beyond the yes-or-no question of whether LLMs understand to investigate\nhow their strange minds work and forge conceptions that fit them.",

    "summary": "Vocabulary acquisition poses a significant challenge for second-language (L2)\nlearners, especially when learning typologically distant languages such as\nEnglish and Korean, where phonological and structural mismatches complicate\nvocabulary learning. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been used to\ngenerate keyword mnemonics by leveraging similar keywords from a learner's\nfirst language (L1) to aid in acquiring L2 vocabulary. However, most of this\nresearch has focused on native English speakers learning other languages,\nrather than the reverse. In this paper, we present PhoniTale, a novel\ncross-lingual mnemonic generation system that retrieves L1 keyword sequence\nbased on phonological similarity and uses LLMs to generate mnemonics. We\nevaluate PhoniTale using both automated metrics and human evaluations,\ncomparing its output to mnemonics created by humans and by previous automated\napproaches. To assess practical effectiveness, we also conduct a short-term\nrecall test measuring mnemonic helpfulness. Our findings show that PhoniTale\nperforms comparably to human-authored mnemonics. We also highlight key areas\nfor future improvement in mnemonic quality and methodology.",

    "summary": "Retrosynthesis, the identification of precursor molecules for a target\ncompound, is pivotal for synthesizing complex molecules, but faces challenges\nin discovering novel pathways beyond predefined templates. Recent large\nlanguage model (LLM) approaches to retrosynthesis have shown promise but\neffectively harnessing LLM reasoning capabilities for effective multi-step\nplanning remains an open question. To address this challenge, we introduce\nDeepRetro, an open-source, iterative, hybrid LLM-based retrosynthetic\nframework. Our approach integrates the strengths of conventional\ntemplate-based/Monte Carlo tree search tools with the generative power of LLMs\nin a step-wise, feedback-driven loop. Initially, synthesis planning is\nattempted with a template-based engine. If this fails, the LLM subsequently\nproposes single-step retrosynthetic disconnections. Crucially, these\nsuggestions undergo rigorous validity, stability, and hallucination checks\nbefore the resulting precursors are recursively fed back into the pipeline for\nfurther evaluation. This iterative refinement allows for dynamic pathway\nexploration and correction. We demonstrate the potential of this pipeline\nthrough benchmark evaluations and case studies, showcasing its ability to\nidentify viable and potentially novel retrosynthetic routes. In particular, we\ndevelop an interactive graphical user interface that allows expert human\nchemists to provide human-in-the-loop feedback to the reasoning algorithm. This\napproach successfully generates novel pathways for complex natural product\ncompounds, demonstrating the potential for iterative LLM reasoning to advance\nstate-of-art in complex chemical syntheses.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like\nmathematics, factual QA, and code generation, yet their multilingual reasoning\ncapabilities in these tasks remain underdeveloped.

This implicit bias toward high-resource\nlanguages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. Current\nmultilingual benchmarks focus only on final answers, overlooking whether models\nactually reason in the target language. To address this gap, we introduce\nGeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark with\nannotated reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese,\nSwahili, and Thai. We further propose BRIDGE, a novel training method that\nguides supervised fine-tuning and test-time reinforcement learning with a\nlanguage-consistency reward to align reasoning with the input language.\nFinally, we develop an automatic evaluation protocol using LLM-as-a-judge to\nassess answer correctness and the quality and language consistency of reasoning\ntraces, enabling nuanced and scalable analysis beyond surface-level metrics.\nOur results show that BRIDGE significantly enhances multilingual reasoning\nfidelity, demonstrating that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement\nlearning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization.\nhttps://jd730.github.io/projects/GeoFact-X_BRIDGE",

Their performance is typically evaluated using programming\nbenchmarks that simulate real-world tasks. These benchmarks provide\nspecifications in the form of docstrings, function signatures, or bug reports.\nThe model then generates a program, which is tested against predefined test\ncases. In contrast, Programming by Example (PBE) uses input-output examples as\nthe specification. Traditional PBE systems rely on search-based methods over\nrestricted transformation spaces. They are usually designed for narrow domains\nand fixed input formats. It remains unclear how well LLMs perform on PBE tasks.\n  In this work, we evaluate LLMs on PBE tasks involving tabular data\ntransformations. We prompt models to generate functions that convert an input\ntable to an output table. We test the generated functions on unseen inputs to\nmeasure accuracy. Our study includes multiple LLMs and evaluates different\nprompting strategies, such as one-shot vs. multi-try. We also compare\nperformance with and without PBE-specific knowledge. Finally, we propose a\nhybrid method that calls a traditional PBE solver first, and then falls back to\nLLMs if necessary.

In this\npaper, we identify four core competencies essential for memory agents: accurate\nretrieval, test-time learning, long-range understanding, and conflict\nresolution. Existing datasets either rely on limited context lengths or are\ntailored for static, long-context settings like book-based QA, which do not\nreflect the interactive, multi-turn nature of memory agents that incrementally\naccumulate information. Furthermore, no existing benchmarks cover all four\ncompetencies. Therefore, we introduce MemoryAgentBench, a new benchmark\nspecifically designed for memory agents. Our benchmark combines reformulated\nexisting datasets with newly constructed ones, covering the above four memory\ncompetencies, providing a systematic and challenging testbed for assessing\nmemory quality. We evaluate a diverse set of memory agents, ranging from simple\ncontext-based and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems to advanced\nagents with external memory modules and tool integration.

We\nuncover a contextual priming vulnerability in which the previous response in\nthe dialogue can steer its subsequent behavior toward policy-violating content.\nBuilding on this insight, we propose Response Attack, which uses an auxiliary\nLLM to generate a mildly harmful response to a paraphrased version of the\noriginal malicious query. They are then formatted into the dialogue and\nfollowed by a succinct trigger prompt, thereby priming the target model to\ngenerate harmful content. Across eight open-source and proprietary LLMs, RA\nconsistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art jailbreak techniques, achieving\nhigher attack success rates. To mitigate this threat, we construct and release\na context-aware safety fine-tuning dataset, which significantly reduces the\nattack success rate while preserving model capabilities.

To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,\nExplain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that\nutilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB\nimage, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure\ndetection - without additional information such as object detection or\npredefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The\nreplanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a\nscene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides\ncorrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.\nLERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from\nboth dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the\nnewly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%\nimprovement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation\ntasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet\nsimulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments,\nincluding real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's\neffectiveness in replanning.

In addition, a detailed analysis of inference\ntimes is conducted to better understand the trade-off between summarization\nquality and computational efficiency. For Long documents, introduce a\nsentence-based chunking strategy that enables LLMs with shorter context windows\nto summarize extended inputs in multiple stages. The findings reveal that while\nLLMs perform competitively on news and dialog tasks, their performance on long\nscientific documents improves significantly when aided by chunking strategies.\nIn addition, notable performance variations were observed based on model\nparameters, dataset properties, and prompt design.

    "summary": "Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical to the performance of\nwireless communication systems, especially with the increasing scale and\ncomplexity introduced by 5G and future 6G technologies. While artificial\nintelligence (AI) offers a promising approach to CSI acquisition and\nutilization, existing methods largely depend on task-specific neural networks\n(NNs) that require expert-driven design and large training datasets, limiting\ntheir generalizability and practicality. To address these challenges, we\npropose LVM4CSI, a general and efficient framework that leverages the\nstructural similarity between CSI and computer vision (CV) data to directly\napply large vision models (LVMs) pre-trained on extensive CV datasets to\nwireless tasks without any fine-tuning, in contrast to large language\nmodel-based methods that generally necessitate fine-tuning. LVM4CSI maps CSI\ntasks to analogous CV tasks, transforms complex-valued CSI into visual formats\ncompatible with LVMs, and integrates lightweight trainable layers to adapt\nextracted features to specific communication objectives. We validate LVM4CSI\nthrough three representative case studies, including channel estimation, human\nactivity recognition, and user localization. Results demonstrate that LVM4CSI\nachieves comparable or superior performance to task-specific NNs, including an\nimprovement exceeding 9.61 dB in channel estimation and approximately 40%\nreduction in localization error. Furthermore, it significantly reduces the\nnumber of trainable parameters and eliminates the need for task-specific NN\ndesign.",

In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically\nverifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or\nreal-world environments.

Behavioural engagement outweighed demographics:\nfrequent use increased trust, whereas self-reported understanding of\nlarge-language-model mechanics reduced it. Among the dimensions, perceived\nexpertise and ethical risk were the strongest predictors of overall trust; ease\nof use and transparency had secondary effects, while human-likeness and\nreputation were non-significant. Trust was highly task-contingent; highest for\ncoding and summarising, lowest for entertainment and citation generation, yet\nconfidence in ChatGPT's referencing ability, despite known inaccuracies, was\nthe single strongest correlate of global trust, indicating automation bias.\nComputer-science students surpassed peers only in trusting the system for\nproofreading and writing, suggesting technical expertise refines rather than\ninflates reliance.

This analysis establishes a link between performance\nscaling and the internal dynamics of neural networks. Our findings of standard\nvision tasks show that similar performance scaling exponents can occur even\nthough the internal model dynamics show opposite behavior. This demonstrates\nthat performance scaling alone is insufficient for understanding the underlying\nmechanisms of neural networks. We also address a previously unresolved issue in\nneural scaling: how convergence to the infinite-width limit affects scaling\nbehavior in finite-width models. To this end, we investigate how feature\nlearning is lost as the model width increases and quantify the transition\nbetween kernel-driven and feature-driven scaling regimes.

To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles\n(AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and\ninteract within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level\nframework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative\nlayers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant\nadvances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine\ninteraction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and\ntool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive\nagents embedded in mobility ecosystems.

    "summary": "In the broader context of deep learning, Multimodal Large Language Models\nhave achieved significant breakthroughs by leveraging powerful Large Language\nModels as a backbone to align different modalities into the language space. A\nprime exemplification is the development of Video Large Language Models\n(Video-LLMs). While numerous advancements have been proposed to enhance the\nvideo understanding capabilities of these models, they are predominantly\ntrained on questions generated directly from video content. However, in\nreal-world scenarios, users often pose questions that extend beyond the\ninformational scope of the video, highlighting the need for Video-LLMs to\nassess the relevance of the question. We demonstrate that even the\nbest-performing Video-LLMs fail to reject unfit questions-not necessarily due\nto a lack of video understanding, but because they have not been trained to\nidentify and refuse such questions. To address this limitation, we propose\nalignment for answerability, a framework that equips Video-LLMs with the\nability to evaluate the relevance of a question based on the input video and\nappropriately decline to answer when the question exceeds the scope of the\nvideo, as well as an evaluation framework with a comprehensive set of metrics\ndesigned to measure model behavior before and after alignment. Furthermore, we\npresent a pipeline for creating a dataset specifically tailored for alignment\nfor answerability, leveraging existing video-description paired datasets.",

    "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable\nprogress in open-ended visual question answering, they remain vulnerable to\nhallucinations. These are outputs that contradict or misrepresent input\nsemantics, posing a critical challenge to the reliability and factual\nconsistency. Existing methods often rely on external verification or post-hoc\ncorrection, lacking an internal mechanism to validate outputs directly during\ntraining. To bridge this gap, we propose ReLoop, a unified closed-loop training\nframework that encourages multimodal consistency for cross-modal understanding\nin MLLMs. ReLoop adopts a ring-shaped structure that integrates three\ncomplementary consistency feedback mechanisms, obliging MLLMs to \"seeing twice\nand thinking backwards\". Specifically, ReLoop employs the frozen Consistency\nFeedback Plugin (CFP), comprising semantic reconstruction, visual description,\nand an attention supervision module for attention alignment. These components\ncollectively enforce semantic reversibility, visual consistency, and\ninterpretable attention, enabling the model to correct its outputs during\ntraining. Extensive evaluations and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of\nReLoop in reducing hallucination rates across multiple benchmarks, establishing\na robust method for hallucination mitigation in MLLMs. We will release our\nsource code and data in the camera-ready version.",

    "summary": "Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) is a key technique in program analysis,\nwidely used in software testing, vulnerability discovery, and formal\nverification. In distributed AI systems, DSE plays a crucial role in\nidentifying hard-to-detect bugs, especially those arising from complex network\ncommunication patterns. However, traditional approaches to symbolic execution\nare often hindered by scalability issues and inefficiencies, particularly in\nlarge-scale systems. This paper introduces LIFT (Large-language-model\nIntegrated Functional-equivalent-IR Transformation), a novel framework that\nleverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the optimization of\nIntermediate Representations (IRs) in symbolic execution. LIFT addresses the\nchallenges of symbolic execution by providing a scalable, context-sensitive\nsolution for IR transformation. The framework consists of two phases: IR\nAnalysis and Optimization, where LLMs optimize time-intensive IR blocks, and\nSymbolic Execution and Validation, which includes benchmarking and semantic\nverification to ensure correctness and generalizability. Experiments on\nreal-world binaries demonstrated significant performance improvements,\nincluding a 53.5\\% reduction in execution time for bigtest and a 10.24\\%\nreduction for random, along with reductions in IR statements, PUT instructions,\nand temporary variables. These results demonstrate that LLMs simplify IRs while\nmaintaining functional correctness, enhancing symbolic execution in distributed\nAI systems.",

The\ndominant paradigm posits that trainable input embeddings serve as foundational\n\"meaning vectors.\" This paper challenges that view. We construct Transformer\nmodels where the embedding layer is entirely frozen, with vectors derived not\nfrom data, but from the visual structure of Unicode glyphs. These non-semantic,\nprecomputed visual embeddings are fixed throughout training. Our method is\ncompatible with any tokenizer, including a novel Unicode-centric tokenizer we\nintroduce to ensure universal text coverage. Despite the absence of trainable,\nsemantically initialized embeddings, our models converge, generate coherent\ntext, and, critically, outperform architecturally identical models with\ntrainable embeddings on the MMLU reasoning benchmark. We attribute this to\n\"representational interference\" in conventional models, where the embedding\nlayer is burdened with learning both structural and semantic features. Our\nresults indicate that high-level semantics are not inherent to input embeddings\nbut are an emergent property of the Transformer's compositional architecture\nand data scale. This reframes the role of embeddings from meaning containers to\nstructural primitives. We release all code and models to foster further\nresearch.",

    "summary": "This paper establishes geopolitical relations as a first-order determinant of\neconomic growth. We construct a novel event-based measure of bilateral\ngeopolitical alignment by employing large language models with web search\ncapabilities to analyze over 440,000 political events across 196 countries from\n1960--2019. This comprehensive measure enables us to identify the precise\ntiming and magnitude of geopolitical shifts within countries over time. Using\nlocal projections with country fixed effects, we find that a\none-standard-deviation improvement in geopolitical relations increases GDP per\ncapita by 9.6 log points over 25 years. These persistent effects operate\nthrough multiple reinforcing channels -- enhanced political stability,\nincreased investment, expanded trade, and productivity gains. Across our\nsample, geopolitical factors generate GDP variations ranging from -35% to +30%,\nwith developing nations facing particularly severe penalties from international\nisolation. Our findings reveal how geopolitical alignment shapes economic\nprosperity in an increasingly fragmented global economy.",

    "summary": "In Decentralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), the development\nof Emergent Communication has long been constrained by the ``Joint Exploration\nDilemma'', leading agents to fall into a ``Communication Vacuum Equilibrium'' .\nTraditional methods address this by introducing inductive biases to facilitate\ncommunication emergence . This study fundamentally questions whether such\nartificial inductive biases are, in fact, over-engineering. Through experiments\nwith the ``AI Mother Tongue'' (AIM) framework, based on a Vector Quantized\nVariational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we demonstrate that when agents possess an\nendogenous symbol system, their neural representations naturally exhibit\nspontaneous semantic compression and Nash equilibrium-driven semantic\nconvergence, achieving effective symbolic communication without external\ninductive biases. This aligns with recent neuroscience findings suggesting that\nthe human brain does not directly use human language for internal thought , and\nresonates with research on ``soft thinking'' capabilities in Large Language\nModels (LLMs) . Compared to traditional explicit communication methods, AIM\ndemonstrates stronger generality and efficiency. The interpretable analysis\ntoolkit developed in this study confirms that symbol usage exhibits a\nsignificant power-law distribution, leading to three major theoretical\ninsights: the ``Neural Communication Hypothesis'', the ``Tool-First\nPrinciple'', and the ``Semantic Interpretability Paradigm''. Future research\nwill explore the integration of Hierarchical Quantized Variational Autoencoders\n(HQ-VAE) to enhance AIM's complex expressive capabilities and investigate the\npotential for ``Reinforcement Learning (RL) Low-Level Pre-training''.

However, these AI-powered extensions introduce unprecedented\nchallenges in testing and reliability assurance. Traditional browser extension\ntesting approaches fail to address the non-deterministic behavior,\ncontext-sensitivity, and complex web environment integration inherent to\nLLM-powered extensions. Similarly, existing LLM testing methodologies operate\nin isolation from browser-specific contexts, creating a critical gap in\neffective evaluation frameworks. To bridge this gap, we present ASSURE, a\nmodular automated testing framework specifically designed for AI-powered\nbrowser extensions. ASSURE comprises three principal components: (1) a modular\ntest case generation engine that supports plugin-based extension of testing\nscenarios, (2) an automated execution framework that orchestrates the complex\ninteractions between web content, extension processing, and AI model behavior,\nand (3) a configurable validation pipeline that systematically evaluates\nbehavioral consistency and security invariants rather than relying on exact\noutput matching. Our evaluation across six widely-used AI browser extensions\ndemonstrates ASSURE's effectiveness, identifying 531 distinct issues spanning\nsecurity vulnerabilities, metamorphic relation violations, and content\nalignment problems. ASSURE achieves 6.4x improved testing throughput compared\nto manual approaches, detecting critical security vulnerabilities within 12.4\nminutes on average.

In this work,\nwe investigate how language models memorize label noise, and why such\nmemorization in many cases does not heavily affect generalizable reasoning\ncapabilities. Using two controllable synthetic reasoning datasets with noisy\nlabels, four-digit addition (FDA) and two-hop relational reasoning (THR), we\ndiscover a reliance of memorization on generalizable reasoning mechanisms:\nmodels continue to compute intermediate reasoning outputs even when retrieving\nmemorized noisy labels, and intervening reasoning adversely affects\nmemorization. We further show that memorization operates through distributed\nencoding, i.e., aggregating various inputs and intermediate results, rather\nthan building a look-up mechanism from inputs to noisy labels. Moreover, our\nFDA case study reveals memorization occurs via outlier heuristics, where\nexisting neuron activation patterns are slightly shifted to fit noisy labels.\nTogether, our findings suggest that memorization of label noise in language\nmodels builds on, rather than overrides, the underlying reasoning mechanisms,\nshedding lights on the intriguing phenomenon of benign memorization.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating\nRegister-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face\na critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional\ncorrectness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods\nbased on supervised fine-tuning often generate functionally correct but\nPPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In\ncontrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after\ngeneration are often inefficient because they operate externally without\nupdating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic\ndesign capabilities.\n  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven\nreinforcement learning framework to train LLMs to generate RTL code that\nachieves both functional correctness and optimized PPA metrics. ChipSeek-R1\nemploys a hierarchical reward system, which incorporates direct feedback on\nsyntax, functional correctness (from simulators) and PPA metrics (from\nsynthesis tools) during reinforcement learning. This enables the model to learn\ncomplex hardware design trade-offs via trial-and-error, generating RTL code\nthat is both functionally correct and PPA-optimized. Evaluating ChipSeek-R1 on\nstandard benchmarks (VerilogEval, RTLLM), we achieve state-of-the-art results\nin functional correctness. Notably, on the RTLLM benchmark, ChipSeek-R1\ngenerated 27 RTL designs surpassing the PPA metrics of the original\nhuman-written code. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating\ntoolchain feedback into LLM training and highlight the potential for\nreinforcement learning to enable automated generation of human-surpassing RTL\ncode. We open-source our code in anonymous github.",

    "summary": "Frontier Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini can decipher\ncryptic compiler errors for novice programmers, but their computational scale,\ncost, and tendency to over-assist make them problematic for widespread\npedagogical adoption. This work demonstrates that smaller, specialised language\nmodels, enhanced via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), present a more viable\nalternative for educational tools. We utilise a new dataset of 40,000 C\ncompiler error explanations, derived from real introductory programming (CS1/2)\nstudent-generated programming errors, which we used to fine-tune three\nopen-source models: Qwen3-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and Qwen3-32B. We performed a dual\nevaluation, combining expert human reviews with a large-scale automated\nanalysis of 8,000 responses using a validated LLM-as-judge ensemble. Our\nresults show that SFT significantly boosts the pedagogical quality of smaller\nmodels, achieving performance comparable to much larger models. We analyse the\ntrade-offs between model size and quality, confirming that fine-tuning compact,\nefficient models on high-quality, domain-specific data is a potent strategy for\ncreating specialised models to drive educational tools.

In this paper, we ask the question -- \\textit{can we leverage LLMs\nto generate a tabular benchmark adequate for evaluating the dataset discovery\nsolutions?} In particular, we focus on the task of finding joinable tables\nwhich is the cornerstone of virtually every dataset discovery method. Current\ncorpora for evaluating dataset discovery methods are mainly based on subsets of\nopen data, and they suffer from three important issues: $i)$ they focus on very\ncommon and generic data types (e.g., address, id, name, etc.); $ii)$ they do\nnot contain human-annotated column pairs; instead, practitioners synthesize\nground truth using table splits (e.g., horizontal for table union search and\nvertical ones for joinability) and $iii)$ they do not focus on semantic column\nrelationships.",

    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) recently showed strong capacity in\nintegrating data among multiple modalities, empowered by a generalizable\nattention architecture. Advanced methods predominantly focus on\nlanguage-centric tuning while less exploring multimodal tokens mixed through\nattention, posing challenges in high-level tasks that require fine-grained\ncognition and emotion understanding. In this work, we identify the attention\ndeficit disorder problem in multimodal learning, caused by inconsistent\ncross-modal attention and layer-by-layer decayed attention activation. To\naddress this, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed MOdular Duplex\nAttention (MODA), simultaneously conducting the inner-modal refinement and\ninter-modal interaction. MODA employs a correct-after-align strategy to\neffectively decouple modality alignment from cross-layer token mixing. In the\nalignment phase, tokens are mapped to duplex modality spaces based on the basis\nvectors, enabling the interaction between visual and language modality.\nFurther, the correctness of attention scores is ensured through adaptive masked\nattention, which enhances the model's flexibility by allowing customizable\nmasking patterns for different modalities. Extensive experiments on 21\nbenchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of MODA in perception, cognition,\nand emotion tasks. Source code and demo are available in\nhttps://zzcheng.top/MODA.",

    "summary": "Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning\n(RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language\nmodels (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to\nachieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to\nthe need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and\nrepeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce\niteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the\npipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for\noptimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent\nLLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select\nschemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary\nprompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian\nrisk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without\nrequiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's\nsuccess rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and\nemploys posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine,\nenabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments\nacross mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS\nreliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly\nreduced LLM rollouts.",

Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,\nignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights.

Additionally, most models rely on\nitem ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their\nability to capture fine-grained item features.

However, existing RAG studies\nprimarily focus on retrieving isolated segments using similarity-based matching\nmethods, while overlooking the intrinsic connections between them. This\nlimitation hampers performance in RAG tasks. To address this, we propose QMKGF,\na Query-Aware Multi-Path Knowledge Graph Fusion Approach for Enhancing\nRetrieval Augmented Generation. First, we design prompt templates and employ\ngeneral-purpose LLMs to extract entities and relations, thereby generating a\nknowledge graph (KG) efficiently. Based on the constructed KG, we introduce a\nmulti-path subgraph construction strategy that incorporates one-hop relations,\nmulti-hop relations, and importance-based relations, aiming to improve the\nsemantic relevance between the retrieved documents and the user query.\nSubsequently, we designed a query-aware attention reward model that scores\nsubgraph triples based on their semantic relevance to the query.

Large Transformer models, including large\nlanguage models (LLMs), often contain computational redundancy, which can serve\nas a target for new model compression methods.

We frame this width reduction as a Discrete Optimal\nTransport problem, and propose DOTResize, a novel Transformer compression\nmethod that uses optimal transport theory to transform and compress model\nweights. To ensure applicability within the Transformer architecture, we\nmotivate and incorporate entropic regularization and matrix factorization into\nthe transportation maps produced by our method. Unlike pruning-based approaches\nwhich discard neurons based on importance measures, DOTResize re-projects the\nentire neuron width, allowing the retention and redistribution of useful signal\nacross the reduced layer.

    "summary": "Diffusion models, originally developed for image generation, have emerged as\na promising alternative to autoregressive large language models (LLMs). We\npresent a theoretical analysis comparing autoregressive and masked diffusion\nLLMs, revealing that the intrinsic bidirectional attention mechanism of\ndiffusion LLMs (dLLMs) enables superior context modeling and generation\ncontrollability. However, existing dLLM applications face significant\nchallenges in controllable generation: the native multi-step denoising process\nexhibits high sensitivity to sequence length, elevated hallucination rates, and\nprohibitive inference costs without specialized optimizations. To address these\nlimitations, we propose \\textbf{S}elf-adaptive \\textbf{S}chema\n\\textbf{S}caffolding ($S^3$), a novel framework that enables dLLMs to generate\nstructured outputs (e.g., JSON) while maintaining semantic fidelity and\naccelerating inference. Our approach injects the target schema structure into\nthe output context, reducing unnecessary computation while improving\ncontrollability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $S^3$ achieves\nsubstantial improvements: 65\\% increase in structural adherence, 48\\%\nenhancement in content fidelity, and 17\\% reduction in hallucination rates\ncompared to baseline.

We present CoT-Diff, a framework that brings\nstep-by-step CoT-style reasoning into T2I generation by tightly integrating\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-driven 3D layout planning with the\ndiffusion process. CoT-Diff enables layout-aware reasoning inline within a\nsingle diffusion round: at each denoising step, the MLLM evaluates intermediate\npredictions, dynamically updates the 3D scene layout, and continuously guides\nthe generation process. The updated layout is converted into semantic\nconditions and depth maps, which are fused into the diffusion model via a\ncondition-aware attention mechanism, enabling precise spatial control and\nsemantic injection. Experiments on 3D Scene benchmarks show that CoT-Diff\nsignificantly improves spatial alignment and compositional fidelity, and\noutperforms the state-of-the-art method by 34.7% in complex scene spatial\naccuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of this entangled generation\nparadigm.",

By\ncasting the attack process as a resource allocation problem between\noptimization and sampling, we determine compute-optimal tradeoffs and show that\nintegrating sampling into existing attacks boosts ASR by up to 48% and improves\nefficiency by up to two orders of magnitude. Our framework also enables us to\nanalyze how different attack algorithms affect output harm distributions.\nSurprisingly, we find that most optimization strategies have little effect on\noutput harmfulness. Finally, we introduce a data-free proof-of-concept\nobjective based on entropy-maximization to demonstrate how our tail-aware\nperspective enables new optimization targets.

While decoding-time strategies provide a\npromising efficient solution without training, existing methods typically treat\ntoken-level and layer-level signals in isolation, overlooking the joint\ndynamics between them. In this work, we introduce a token-aware,\nlayer-localized contrastive decoding method that aligns specific token types\nwith their most influential transformer layers to improve factual generation.\nThrough empirical attention analysis, we identify two key patterns: punctuation\ntokens receive dominant attention in early layers, while conceptual tokens\ngovern semantic reasoning in intermediate layers. By selectively suppressing\nattention to these token types at their respective depths, we achieve the\ninduction of controlled factual degradation and derive contrastive signals to\nguide the final factual decoding.

    "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly\nimproved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating\ncomplex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced\ntrajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed\nself-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from\nreal-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches\nencounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where\nreal or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic\nfeedback, complicating the reproduction and debugging of agent behaviors; and\n(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can\ninvolve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and\ncomputational expenses. To address these limitations and enable scalable\nself-improvement for agents, we propose WebSynthesis, a novel framework for\ntrajectory synthesis and training. WebSynthesis leverages a learned world model\nto simulate virtual web environments, allowing a policy agent to perform\nefficient and reversible tree-based planning. This approach supports the\nlarge-scale generation of diverse and high-quality trajectories, which are\nsubsequently utilized to refine the agent's policy. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that an agent trained using WebSynthesis on a small-scale synthetic\ndataset achieves performance comparable to or even surpassing that of models\ntrained on large-scale real-world data.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) become more integral to society and\ntechnology, ensuring their safety becomes essential. Jailbreak attacks exploit\nvulnerabilities to bypass safety guardrails, posing a significant threat.\nHowever, the mechanisms enabling these attacks are not well understood. In this\npaper, we reveal a universal phenomenon that occurs during jailbreak attacks:\nAttention Slipping. During this phenomenon, the model gradually reduces the\nattention it allocates to unsafe requests in a user query during the attack\nprocess, ultimately causing a jailbreak. We show Attention Slipping is\nconsistent across various jailbreak methods, including gradient-based token\nreplacement, prompt-level template refinement, and in-context learning.\nAdditionally, we evaluate two defenses based on query perturbation, Token\nHighlighter and SmoothLLM, and find they indirectly mitigate Attention\nSlipping, with their effectiveness positively correlated with the degree of\nmitigation achieved. Inspired by this finding, we propose Attention Sharpening,\na new defense that directly counters Attention Slipping by sharpening the\nattention score distribution using temperature scaling. Experiments on four\nleading LLMs (Gemma2-9B-It, Llama3.1-8B-It, Qwen2.5-7B-It, Mistral-7B-It v0.2)\nshow that our method effectively resists various jailbreak attacks while\nmaintaining performance on benign tasks on AlpacaEval.

    "summary": "Machine learning methods are increasingly applied to analyze health-related\npublic discourse based on large-scale data, but questions remain regarding\ntheir ability to accurately detect different types of health sentiments.\nEspecially, Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained attention as a powerful\ntechnology, yet their accuracy and feasibility in capturing different opinions\nand perspectives on health issues are largely unexplored. Thus, this research\nexamines how accurate the three prominent LLMs (GPT, Gemini, and LLAMA) are in\ndetecting risk-promoting versus health-supporting sentiments across two\ncritical public health topics: Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination and\nheated tobacco products (HTPs). Drawing on data from Facebook and Twitter, we\ncurated multiple sets of messages supporting or opposing recommended health\nbehaviors, supplemented with human annotations as the gold standard for\nsentiment classification. The findings indicate that all three LLMs generally\ndemonstrate substantial accuracy in classifying risk-promoting and\nhealth-supporting sentiments, although notable discrepancies emerge by\nplatform, health issue, and model type. Specifically, models often show higher\naccuracy for risk-promoting sentiment on Facebook, whereas health-supporting\nmessages on Twitter are more accurately detected. An additional analysis also\nshows the challenges LLMs face in reliably detecting neutral messages. These\nresults highlight the importance of carefully selecting and validating language\nmodels for public health analyses, particularly given potential biases in\ntraining data that may lead LLMs to overestimate or underestimate the\nprevalence of certain perspectives.",

However, these approaches pay\nless attention to the spatial continuity and inter-slice correlations in the\nvolumetric CT data, leading to fragmented and imprecise responses.

This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking\ncommunities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack\nsophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and\ncomplexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,\nindicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in\ncomplexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak\ndevelopment.\n  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race\nbetween attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution\nis bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue\nadvancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic\njailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity\nbaselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm\nbefore defensive adaptation.",

    "summary": "Large Language Model-enhanced Recommender Systems (LLM-enhanced RSs) have\nemerged as a powerful approach to improving recommendation quality by\nleveraging LLMs to generate item representations. Despite these advancements,\nthe integration of LLMs raises severe fairness concerns. Existing studies\nreveal that LLM-based RSs exhibit greater unfairness than traditional RSs, yet\nfairness issues in LLM-enhanced RSs remain largely unexplored. In this paper,\nour empirical study reveals that while LLM-enhanced RSs improve fairness across\nitem groups, a significant fairness gap persists. Further enhancement remains\nchallenging due to the architectural differences and varying sources of\nunfairness inherent in LLM-enhanced RSs. To bridge this gap, we first decompose\nunfairness into i) \\textit{prior unfairness} in LLM-generated representations\nand ii) \\textit{training unfairness} in recommendation models. Then, we propose\nBiFair, a bi-level optimization-based fairness-aware training framework\ndesigned to mitigate both prior and training unfairness simultaneously. BiFair\noptimizes two sets of learnable parameters: LLM-generated representations and a\ntrainable projector in the recommendation model, using a two-level nested\noptimization process. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive inter-group\nbalancing mechanism, leveraging multi-objective optimization principles to\ndynamically balance fairness across item groups. Extensive experiments on three\nreal-world datasets demonstrate that BiFair significantly mitigates unfairness\nand outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.",

    "summary": "With the rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in multi-modal\nunderstanding, there is increasing potential for video comprehension\ntechnologies to support professional domains such as medical education.\nHowever, existing benchmarks suffer from two primary limitations: (1)\nLinguistic Singularity: they are largely confined to English, neglecting the\nneed for multilingual resources; and (2) Shallow Reasoning: their questions are\noften designed for surface-level information retrieval, failing to properly\nassess deep multi-modal integration. To address these limitations, we present\nM3-Med, the first benchmark for Multi-lingual, Multi-modal, and Multi-hop\nreasoning in Medical instructional video understanding. M3-Med consists of\nmedical questions paired with corresponding video segments, annotated by a team\nof medical experts. A key innovation of M3-Med is its multi-hop reasoning task,\nwhich requires a model to first locate a key entity in the text, then find\ncorresponding visual evidence in the video, and finally synthesize information\nacross both modalities to derive the answer. This design moves beyond simple\ntext matching and poses a substantial challenge to a model's deep cross-modal\nunderstanding capabilities. We define two tasks: Temporal Answer Grounding in\nSingle Video (TAGSV) and Temporal Answer Grounding in Video Corpus (TAGVC). We\nevaluated several state-of-the-art models and Large Language Models (LLMs) on\nM3-Med. The results reveal a significant performance gap between all models and\nhuman experts, especially on the complex multi-hop questions where model\nperformance drops sharply. M3-Med effectively highlights the current\nlimitations of AI models in deep cross-modal reasoning within specialized\ndomains and provides a new direction for future research.",

    "summary": "With the recent success of large language models, Explainable Multimodal\nEmotion Recognition (EMER), also known as Descriptive MER (DMER), has attracted\ngrowing attention from researchers. Unlike traditional discriminative methods\nthat rely on predefined emotion taxonomies, EMER aims to describe a person's\nemotional state using free-form natural language, thereby enabling fine-grained\nand interpretable emotion representations. However, this free-form prediction\nparadigm introduces significant challenges in evaluation. Existing approaches\neither depend on ground-truth descriptions, which require extensive manual\nannotations and often fail to capture the full complexity of human emotions, or\nsimplify the evaluation task by shifting focus from assessing descriptions to\nevaluating emotion labels. However, this simplification overlooks critical\naspects such as emotional temporal dynamics, intensity, and uncertainty. To\naddress these limitations, we propose EMER-Ranker, a novel evaluation strategy\nthat reformulates the traditional ``prediction-ground truth'' comparison into\nthe ``prediction-prediction'' comparison, eliminating the need for ground-truth\ndescriptions. We then apply the Bradley-Terry algorithm to convert pairwise\ncomparison outcomes into model-level rankings. Additionally, we explore the\npotential for automatic preference prediction and introduce EMER-Preference,\nthe first preference dataset specifically designed for human emotions.

    "title": "Mpemba Effect in Large-Language Model Training Dynamics: A Minimal\n  Analysis of the Valley-River model",
    "summary": "Learning rate (LR) schedules in large language model (LLM) training often\nfollow empirical templates: warm-up, constant plateau/stable phase, and decay\n(WSD). However, the mechanistic explanation for this strategy remains\nunderexplored, and the choice of plateau height and decay schedule is largely\nheuristic. In this paper, we connect training dynamics to a thermodynamic\nanalogy via the Mpemba effect - a phenomenon in which a hotter system cools\nfaster than a colder one when quenched into the same bath. We analyze a class\nof \"valley-river\" loss landscapes, where sharp (valley) directions equilibrate\nquickly, while flatter (river) directions govern global descent. The Mpemba\neffect provides an explanation for the necessity of the warm-up phase and\nmotivates a high plateau - rather than a low one - for accelerating loss\ndecrease during decay. We show that for certain loss landscapes, there exists\nan optimal plateau learning rate - the \"strong Mpemba point\" - at which the\nslowest mode vanishes, resulting in faster convergence during the decay phase.\nWe derive analytical conditions for its existence and estimate decay dynamics\nrequired to preserve the Mpemba advantage. Our minimal model and analysis offer\na principled justification for plateau-based schedulers and provide guidance\nfor tuning LR in LLMs with minimal hyperparameter sweep.",

Yet, their effectiveness on clinical natural language inference\n(NLI) remains underexplored. This study presents the first controlled\nevaluation of how prompt structure and efficient fine-tuning jointly shape\nmodel performance in clinical NLI. We inspect four classes of prompting\nstrategies to elicit reasoning in LLMs at different levels of abstraction, and\nevaluate their impact on a range of clinically motivated reasoning types. For\neach prompting strategy, we construct high-quality demonstrations using a\nfrontier model to distil multi-step reasoning capabilities into smaller models\n(4B parameters) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Across different language\nmodels fine-tuned on the NLI4CT benchmark, we found that prompt type alone\naccounts for up to 44% of the variance in macro-F1. Moreover, LoRA fine-tuning\nyields consistent gains of +8 to 12 F1, raises output alignment above 97%, and\nnarrows the performance gap to GPT-4o-mini to within 7.1%. Additional\nexperiments on reasoning generalisation reveal that LoRA improves performance\nin 75% of the models on MedNLI and TREC Clinical Trials Track. Overall, these\nfindings demonstrate that (i) prompt structure is a primary driver of clinical\nreasoning performance, (ii) compact models equipped with strong prompts and\nLoRA can rival frontier-scale systems, and (iii) reasoning-type-aware\nevaluation is essential to uncover prompt-induced trade-offs. Our results\nhighlight the promise of combining prompt design and lightweight adaptation for\nmore efficient and trustworthy clinical NLP systems, providing insights on the\nstrengths and limitations of widely adopted prompting and parameter-efficient\ntechniques in highly specialised domains.",

    "title": "HAWK: A Hierarchical Workflow Framework for Multi-Agent Collaboration",
    "summary": "Contemporary multi-agent systems encounter persistent challenges in\ncross-platform interoperability, dynamic task scheduling, and efficient\nresource sharing. Agents with heterogeneous implementations often lack\nstandardized interfaces; collaboration frameworks remain brittle and hard to\nextend; scheduling policies are static; and inter-agent state synchronization\nis insufficient. We propose Hierarchical Agent Workflow (HAWK), a modular\nframework comprising five layers-User, Workflow, Operator, Agent, and\nResource-and supported by sixteen standardized interfaces. HAWK delivers an\nend-to-end pipeline covering task parsing, workflow orchestration, intelligent\nscheduling, resource invocation, and data synchronization. At its core lies an\nadaptive scheduling and optimization module in the Workflow Layer, which\nharnesses real-time feedback and dynamic strategy adjustment to maximize\nutilization. The Resource Layer provides a unified abstraction over\nheterogeneous data sources, large models, physical devices, and third-party\nservices&tools, simplifying cross-domain information retrieval. We demonstrate\nHAWK's scalability and effectiveness via CreAgentive, a multi-agent\nnovel-generation prototype, which achieves marked gains in throughput, lowers\ninvocation complexity, and improves system controllability. We also show how\nhybrid deployments of large language models integrate seamlessly within HAWK,\nhighlighting its flexibility. Finally, we outline future research\navenues-hallucination mitigation, real-time performance tuning, and enhanced\ncross-domain adaptability-and survey prospective applications in healthcare,\ngovernment, finance, and education.",

    "summary": "Code readability is one of the main aspects of code quality, influenced by\nvarious properties like identifier names, comments, code structure, and\nadherence to standards. However, measuring this attribute poses challenges in\nboth industry and academia. While static analysis tools assess attributes such\nas code smells and comment percentage, code reviews introduce an element of\nsubjectivity. This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to\nevaluate code quality attributes related to its readability in a standardized,\nreproducible, and consistent manner. We conducted a quasi-experiment study to\nmeasure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s\ninterpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were\ntested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier\nnames with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each\nintervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response\nvariability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The\nresults showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with\nagreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and\nrefactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity\nthat the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs\nreasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each\nintervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to\n14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating\nresponse oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical\nsignificance of the results. LLMs demonstrated potential for evaluating\nsemantic quality aspects, such as coherence between identifier names, comments,\nand documentation with code purpose.",

    "title": "Leveraging Multimodal Data and Side Users for Diffusion Cross-Domain\n  Recommendation",
    "summary": "Cross-domain recommendation (CDR) aims to address the persistent cold-start\nproblem in Recommender Systems. Current CDR research concentrates on\ntransferring cold-start users' information from the auxiliary domain to the\ntarget domain. However, these systems face two main issues: the\nunderutilization of multimodal data, which hinders effective cross-domain\nalignment, and the neglect of side users who interact solely within the target\ndomain, leading to inadequate learning of the target domain's vector space\ndistribution. To address these issues, we propose a model leveraging Multimodal\ndata and Side users for diffusion Cross-domain recommendation (MuSiC). We first\nemploy a multimodal large language model to extract item multimodal features\nand leverage a large language model to uncover user features using prompt\nlearning without fine-tuning. Secondly, we propose the cross-domain diffusion\nmodule to learn the generation of feature vectors in the target domain. This\napproach involves learning feature distribution from side users and\nunderstanding the patterns in cross-domain transformation through overlapping\nusers. Subsequently, the trained diffusion module is used to generate feature\nvectors for cold-start users in the target domain, enabling the completion of\ncross-domain recommendation tasks. Finally, our experimental evaluation of the\nAmazon dataset confirms that MuSiC achieves state-of-the-art performance,\nsignificantly outperforming all selected baselines.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate responses that are factually\nincorrect yet expressed with high confidence, which can pose serious risks for\nend users. To address this, it is essential for LLMs not only to produce\nanswers but also to provide accurate estimates of their correctness.\nUncertainty quantification methods have been introduced to assess the quality\nof LLM outputs, with factual accuracy being a key aspect of that quality. Among\nthese methods, those that leverage hidden states to train probes have shown\nparticular promise, as these internal representations encode information\nrelevant to the factuality of responses, making this approach the focus of this\npaper. However, the probe trained on the hidden states of one dataset often\nstruggles to generalise to another dataset of a different task or domain. To\naddress this limitation, we explore combining data-agnostic features with\nhidden-state features and assess whether this hybrid feature set enhances\nout-of-domain performance. We further examine whether selecting only the most\ninformative hidden-state features, thereby discarding task-specific noise,\nenables the data-agnostic features to contribute more effectively. The\nexperiment results indicate that although introducing data-agnostic features\ngenerally enhances generalisation performance in most cases, in certain\nscenarios their inclusion degrades performance. A similar pattern emerges when\nretaining only the most important hidden-state features - adding data-agnostic\nfeatures does not consistently further enhance performance compared to using\nthe full set of hidden-state features. A closer analysis reveals that, in some\nspecific cases, the trained probe underweights the data-agnostic features\nrelative to the hidden-state features, which we believe is the main reason why\nthe results are inconclusive.",

    "summary": "Complementary recommendations enhance the user experience by suggesting items\nthat are frequently purchased together while serving different functions from\nthe query item. Inferring or evaluating whether two items have a complementary\nrelationship requires complementary relationship labels; however, defining\nthese labels is challenging because of the inherent ambiguity of such\nrelationships. Complementary labels based on user historical behavior logs\nattempt to capture these relationships, but often produce inconsistent and\nunreliable results. Recent efforts have introduced large language models (LLMs)\nto infer these relationships. However, these approaches provide a binary\nclassification without a nuanced understanding of complementary relationships.\nIn this study, we address these challenges by introducing Function-Based Labels\n(FBLs), a novel definition of complementary relationships independent of user\npurchase logs and the opaque decision processes of LLMs. We constructed a\nhuman-annotated FBLs dataset comprising 2,759 item pairs and demonstrated that\nit covered possible item relationships and minimized ambiguity. We then\nevaluated whether some machine learning (ML) methods using annotated FBLs could\naccurately infer labels for unseen item pairs, and whether LLM-generated\ncomplementary labels align with human perception. Our results demonstrate that\neven with limited data, ML models, such as logistic regression and SVM achieve\nhigh macro-F1 scores (approximately 0.82). Furthermore, LLMs, such as\ngpt-4o-mini, demonstrated high consistency (0.989) and classification accuracy\n(0.849) under the detailed definition of FBLs, indicating their potential as\neffective annotators that mimic human judgment. Overall, our study presents\nFBLs as a clear definition of complementary relationships, enabling more\naccurate inferences and automated labeling of complementary recommendations.",

Model collapse refers to the eventual\nconsequence of self-consuming training loops, where models reinforce their own\nbiases and lose linguistic diversity.

However, existing\nMAD methods face two major issues: (a) too lengthy input contexts, which causes\nLLM agents to get lost in plenty of input information and experiences\nperformance drop; and (b) the overconfidence dilemma, where self-assured LLM\nagents dominate the debate, leading to low debating effectiveness. To address\nthese limitations, we propose a novel MAD method called \"CortexDebate\".\nInspired by the human brain's tendency to establish a sparse and dynamically\noptimized network among cortical areas governed by white matter, CortexDebate\nconstructs a sparse debating graph among LLM agents, where each LLM agent only\ndebates with the ones that are helpful to it. To optimize the graph, we propose\na module named McKinsey-based Debate Matter (MDM), which acts as an artificial\nanalog to white matter.

    "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a widely adopted mechanism\nfor connecting large language models to external tools and resources. While MCP\npromises seamless extensibility and rich integrations, it also introduces a\nsubstantially expanded attack surface: any plugin can inherit broad system\nprivileges with minimal isolation or oversight. In this work, we conduct the\nfirst large-scale empirical analysis of MCP security risks. We develop an\nautomated static analysis framework and systematically examine 2,562 real-world\nMCP applications spanning 23 functional categories. Our measurements reveal\nthat network and system resource APIs dominate usage patterns, affecting 1,438\nand 1,237 servers respectively, while file and memory resources are less\nfrequent but still significant. We find that Developer Tools and API\nDevelopment plugins are the most API-intensive, and that less popular plugins\noften contain disproportionately high-risk operations. Through concrete case\nstudies, we demonstrate how insufficient privilege separation enables privilege\nescalation, misinformation propagation, and data tampering. Based on these\nfindings, we propose a detailed taxonomy of MCP resource access, quantify\nsecurity-relevant API usage, and identify open challenges for building safer\nMCP ecosystems, including dynamic permission models and automated trust\nassessment.",

    "title": "LLMs model how humans induce logically structured rules",
    "summary": "A central goal of cognitive science is to provide a computationally explicit\naccount of both the structure of the mind and its development: what are the\nprimitive representational building blocks of cognition, what are the rules via\nwhich those primitives combine, and where do these primitives and rules come\nfrom in the first place? A long-standing debate concerns the adequacy of\nartificial neural networks as computational models that can answer these\nquestions, in particular in domains related to abstract cognitive function,\nsuch as language and logic. This paper argues that recent advances in neural\nnetworks -- specifically, the advent of large language models (LLMs) --\nrepresent an important shift in this debate. We test a variety of LLMs on an\nexisting experimental paradigm used for studying the induction of rules\nformulated over logical concepts. Across four experiments, we find converging\nempirical evidence that LLMs provide at least as good a fit to human behavior\nas models that implement a Bayesian probablistic language of thought (pLoT),\nwhich have been the best computational models of human behavior on the same\ntask. Moreover, we show that the LLMs make qualitatively different predictions\nabout the nature of the rules that are inferred and deployed in order to\ncomplete the task, indicating that the LLM is unlikely to be a mere\nimplementation of the pLoT solution. Based on these results, we argue that LLMs\nmay instantiate a novel theoretical account of the primitive representations\nand computations necessary to explain human logical concepts, with which future\nwork in cognitive science should engage.",

    "summary": "Attention mechanisms are central to the success of large language models\n(LLMs), enabling them to capture intricate token dependencies and implicitly\nassign importance to each token. Recent studies have revealed the sink token,\nwhich receives disproportionately high attention despite their limited semantic\nrole. In this paper, we first expand the relationship between the sink token\nand other tokens, moving beyond attention to explore their similarity in hidden\nstates, considering the layer depth. We observe that as the layers get deeper,\nthe cosine similarity between the normalized hidden states of the sink token\nand those of other tokens increases, and that the normalized hidden states of\nthe sink token exhibit negligible changes. These imply that other tokens\nconsistently are directed toward the sink token throughout the layers. Next, we\npropose a dynamic token selection method, called OrthoRank, using these\nfindings to select important tokens. Specifically, in a certain layer, we\ndefine token importance by the speed at which the token moves toward the sink\ntoken. This is converted into orthogonality with the sink token, meaning that\ntokens that are more orthogonal to the sink token are assigned greater\nimportance. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that our\nmethod results in lower perplexity and higher zero-shot accuracy compared to\nlayer pruning methods at the same sparsity ratio with comparable throughput,\nwhile also achieving superior performance on LongBench.",

However, this assumption often does not hold in\nLLMs. Instead, LLM activations exhibit stronger low-rank structure-prompting a\nshift toward minimizing activation reconstruction error.\n  We show that this shift alone is insufficient: activation dimensions\ncontribute unequally to model performance, and uniform reconstruction can harm\nperformance. We propose IMPACT, a principled framework for importance-aware\nactivation reconstruction that links model compression decisions to their\nimpact on model behavior. IMPACT formulates an optimization problem that\nconsiders both activation structure and gradient sensitivity, and derives a\nclosed-form solution where the optimal reconstruction bases are the\neigenvectors of an importance-weighted activation covariance matrix. This\nenables low-rank approximations explicitly optimized to preserve accuracy.\nExperiments across diverse models and tasks show that IMPACT achieves up to\n48.6% greater model size reduction with accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art\nbaselines.",

The agents are implemented as\nzero-shot ReAct agents. Rather than producing an answer in a single step, the\nmodel now decides between 3 actions a) classify b) resolve c) answer. Action a)\ndecides if the question is incomplete, ambiguous, or normal. Action b)\ndetermines if any deficiencies identified can be resolved. Action c) answers\nthe resolved form of the question. We compare the use of LLMs with and without\nthe use of agents with these components. Our results show benefits of agents\nwith transducer 1) A shortening of the length of interactions with human 2) An\nimprovement in the answer quality and 3) Explainable resolution of deficiencies\nin the question. On the negative side we find while it may result in additional\nLLM invocations and in some cases, increased latency. But on tested datasets,\nthe benefits outweigh the costs except when questions already have sufficient\ncontext. Suggesting the agent-based approach could be a useful mechanism to\nharness the power of LLMs to develop more robust QA systems.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have become an essential infrastructure for\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI), yet their lack of well-defined memory\nmanagement systems hinders the development of long-context reasoning, continual\npersonalization, and knowledge consistency.Existing models mainly rely on\nstatic parameters and short-lived contextual states, limiting their ability to\ntrack user preferences or update knowledge over extended periods.While\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) introduces external knowledge in plain\ntext, it remains a stateless workaround without lifecycle control or\nintegration with persistent representations.Recent work has modeled the\ntraining and inference cost of LLMs from a memory hierarchy perspective,\nshowing that introducing an explicit memory layer between parameter memory and\nexternal retrieval can substantially reduce these costs by externalizing\nspecific knowledge. Beyond computational efficiency, LLMs face broader\nchallenges arising from how information is distributed over time and context,\nrequiring systems capable of managing heterogeneous knowledge spanning\ndifferent temporal scales and sources. To address this challenge, we propose\nMemOS, a memory operating system that treats memory as a manageable system\nresource. It unifies the representation, scheduling, and evolution of\nplaintext, activation-based, and parameter-level memories, enabling\ncost-efficient storage and retrieval. As the basic unit, a MemCube encapsulates\nboth memory content and metadata such as provenance and versioning. MemCubes\ncan be composed, migrated, and fused over time, enabling flexible transitions\nbetween memory types and bridging retrieval with parameter-based learning.\nMemOS establishes a memory-centric system framework that brings\ncontrollability, plasticity, and evolvability to LLMs, laying the foundation\nfor continual learning and personalized modeling.",

Business angels offer a\ncritical source of funding, but their decision-making is often subjective and\nresource-intensive for both investor and entrepreneur. Much research has\ninvestigated this investment process to find the critical factors angels\nconsider. One such tool, the Critical Factor Assessment (CFA), deployed more\nthan 20,000 times by the Canadian Innovation Centre, has been evaluated\npost-decision and found to be significantly more accurate than investors' own\ndecisions. However, a single CFA analysis requires three trained individuals\nand several days, limiting its adoption. This study builds on previous work\nvalidating the CFA to investigate whether the constraints inhibiting its\nadoption can be overcome using a trained AI model. In this research, we\nprompted multiple large language models (LLMs) to assign the eight CFA factors\nto a dataset of 600 transcribed, unstructured startup pitches seeking business\nangel funding with known investment outcomes. We then trained and evaluated\nmachine learning classification models using the LLM-generated CFA scores as\ninput features. Our best-performing model demonstrated high predictive accuracy\n(85.0% for predicting BA deal/no-deal outcomes) and exhibited significant\ncorrelation (Spearman's r = 0.896, p-value < 0.001) with conventional\nhuman-graded evaluations.

These results prompted concerns about the emergence of\nharmful behaviors from narrow domain fine-tuning. In this paper, we\ncontextualize these findings by analyzing how such narrow adaptation impacts\nthe internal mechanisms and behavioral manifestations of LLMs. Through a series\nof experiments covering output probability distributions, loss and gradient\nvector geometry, layer-wise activation dynamics, and activation space\ndimensions, we find that behaviors attributed to \"emergent misalignment\" may be\nbetter interpreted as an erosion of prior alignment. We show that fine tuning\non insecure code induces internal changes that oppose alignment. Further, we\nidentify a shared latent dimension in the model's activation space that governs\nalignment behavior. We show that this space is activated by insecure code and\nby misaligned responses more generally, revealing how narrow fine-tuning can\ndegrade general safety behavior by interfering with shared internal mechanisms.\nOur findings offer a mechanistic interpretation for previously observed\nmisalignment phenomena, and highlights the fragility of alignment in LLMs. The\nresults underscore the need for more robust fine-tuning strategies that\npreserve intended behavior across domains.",

In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger\ncorrectness criteria for effective repairs.\n  We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming\nlanguage that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions,\npost-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair.\nAssuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs,\nwe localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic\nto determine the state of each statement within the program and\nstate-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes.\nThe chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B.\n  We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny\nprograms. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o\nmini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight\nthe potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis\nfor automated program repair.",

    "summary": "Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of\nLarge Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a\ntime-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This\nstudy investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization\nframework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five\nuse cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code\ngeneration, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how\nprompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases\ndemonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use\ncase and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed\nnotable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a\nsubstantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the\nrouter agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and\nof a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was\nexplored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%,\nusing the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance.\nOverall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt\noptimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning\nand example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by\ntask, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt\noptimization research.",

To\nmitigate the problem of dataset misuse, this paper explores \\textit{dataset\ninference}, which aims to detect if a suspect model $\\mathcal{M}$ used a victim\ndataset $\\mathcal{D}$ in training. Previous research tackles dataset inference\nby aggregating results of membership inference attacks (MIAs) -- methods to\ndetermine whether individual samples are a part of the training dataset.\nHowever, restricted by the low accuracy of MIAs, previous research mandates\ngrey-box access to $\\mathcal{M}$ to get intermediate outputs (probabilities,\nloss, perplexity, etc.) for obtaining satisfactory results. This leads to\nreduced practicality, as LLMs, especially those deployed for profits, have\nlimited incentives to return the intermediate outputs.\n  In this paper, we propose a new method of dataset inference with only\nblack-box access to the target model (i.e., assuming only the text-based\nresponses of the target model are available). Our method is enabled by two sets\nof locally built reference models, one set involving $\\mathcal{D}$ in training\nand the other not.

However, existing MAS frameworks often\nrequire manual workflow configuration and lack native support for dynamic\nevolution and performance optimization. In addition, many MAS optimization\nalgorithms are not integrated into a unified framework. In this paper, we\npresent EvoAgentX, an open-source platform that automates the generation,\nexecution, and evolutionary optimization of multi-agent workflows. EvoAgentX\nemploys a modular architecture consisting of five core layers: the basic\ncomponents, agent, workflow, evolving, and evaluation layers. Specifically,\nwithin the evolving layer, EvoAgentX integrates three MAS optimization\nalgorithms, TextGrad, AFlow, and MIPRO, to iteratively refine agent prompts,\ntool configurations, and workflow topologies.

To overcome this\nfundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that\nelevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our\nframework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder,\nincorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial\nDisentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual\ndescriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's\nfeatures to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns\na representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time\nCausal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM\ninterprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation\ndecoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct\nan extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public\ndatasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under\ncross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings.

Traditional methods face the\nfollowing two challenges when dealing with the feature generation of scientific\ndata: First, the effective construction of high-order feature combinations in\nscientific data necessitates profound and extensive domain-specific expertise.\nSecondly, as the order of feature combinations increases, the search space\nexpands exponentially, imposing prohibitive human labor consumption.\nAdvancements in the Data-Centric Artificial Intelligence (DCAI) paradigm have\nopened novel avenues for automating feature generation processes. Inspired by\nthat, this paper revisits the conventional feature generation workflow and\nproposes the Multi-agent Feature Generation (MAFG) framework. Specifically, in\nthe iterative exploration stage, multi-agents will construct mathematical\ntransformation equations collaboratively, synthesize and identify feature\ncombinations ex-hibiting high information content, and leverage a reinforcement\nlearning mechanism to evolve their strategies. Upon completing the exploration\nphase, MAFG integrates the large language models (LLMs) to interpreta-tively\nevaluate the generated features of each significant model performance\nbreakthrough. Experimental results and case studies consistently demonstrate\nthat the MAFG framework effectively automates the feature generation process\nand significantly enhances various downstream scientific data mining tasks.",

    "summary": "Pre-timed traffic signal control, commonly used for operating signalized\nintersections and coordinated arterials, requires tedious manual work for\nsignaling plan creating and updating. When the time-of-day or day-of-week plans\nare utilized, one intersection is often associated with multiple plans, leading\nto further repetitive manual plan parameter inputting. To enable a\nuser-friendly traffic signal control plan management process, this study\nproposes Chat2SPaT, a method to convert users' semi-structured and ambiguous\ndescriptions on the signal control plan to exact signal phase and timing (SPaT)\nresults, which could further be transformed into structured stage-based or\nring-based plans to interact with intelligent transportation system (ITS)\nsoftware and traffic signal controllers. With curated prompts, Chat2SPaT first\nleverages large language models' (LLMs) capability of understanding users' plan\ndescriptions and reformulate the plan as a combination of phase sequence and\nphase attribute results in the json format. Based on LLM outputs, python\nscripts are designed to locate phases in a cycle, address nuances of traffic\nsignal control, and finally assemble the complete traffic signal control plan.\nWithin a chat, the pipeline can be utilized iteratively to conduct further plan\nediting. Experiments show that Chat2SPaT can generate plans with an accuracy of\nover 94% for both English and Chinese cases, using a test dataset with over 300\nplan descriptions. As the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs' capability of\nunderstanding traffic signal control plan descriptions, Chat2SPaT provides an\neasy-to-use plan management pipeline for traffic practitioners and researchers,\nserving as a potential new building block for a more accurate and versatile\napplication of LLMs in the field of ITS.

However, traditional approaches rely\non human-driven hypothesis testing and selection of association factors, often\noverlooking complex, non-linear dependencies among imaging phenotypes and other\nmulti-modal data. To address this, we introduce a Multi-agent Exploratory\nSynergy for the Heart (MESHAgents) framework that leverages large language\nmodels as agents to dynamically elicit, surface, and decide confounders and\nphenotypes in association studies, using cardiovascular imaging as a proof of\nconcept. Specifically, we orchestrate a multi-disciplinary team of AI agents --\nspanning cardiology, biomechanics, statistics, and clinical research -- which\nspontaneously generate and converge on insights through iterative,\nself-organizing reasoning. The framework dynamically synthesizes statistical\ncorrelations with multi-expert consensus, providing an automated pipeline for\nphenome-wide association studies (PheWAS). We demonstrate the system's\ncapabilities through a population-based study of imaging phenotypes of the\nheart and aorta. MESHAgents autonomously uncovered correlations between imaging\nphenotypes and a wide range of non-imaging factors, identifying additional\nconfounder variables beyond standard demographic factors. Validation on\ndiagnosis tasks reveals that MESHAgents-discovered phenotypes achieve\nperformance comparable to expert-selected phenotypes, with mean AUC differences\nas small as -0.004 on disease classification tasks. Notably, the recall score\nimproves for 6 out of 9 disease types.

Key findings include an estimated total of\nEUR 4.65 billion in AI-related public investment in Hungary. Openly available\nfinancial data was found for only half of the evaluated goals, and just three\nprojects made up 98\\% of all documented funding. The research also reveals\nHungary's implementation challenges, including fragmented execution following\nministerial reorganizations and the absence of designated biennial reviews\nsince 2020. Furthermore, the paper provides targeted recommendations for\nHungary's forthcoming AI strategy, drawing on Singapore's framework as a\nreference point.

Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome\nhand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face\nlimitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how\nLLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.\nThough promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly\nincluding high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost\nand suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token\nsequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical\nfeatures.\n  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to\nalleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \\textbf{LLM4Hint}\nthat leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization\nhints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model\nto produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the\nSQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously\nreducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting\nstrategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the\nbackbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit\nmatching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight\nmodel, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show\nthat LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the\nquery statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in\nterms of both effectiveness and generalization.",

Reliable\ndetection of MGT is therefore essential. However, existing work primarily\nevaluates MGT detectors on generic generation tasks rather than on tasks more\ncommonly performed by Wikipedia editors. This misalignment can lead to poor\ngeneralisability when applied in real-world Wikipedia contexts. We introduce\nWETBench, a multilingual, multi-generator, and task-specific benchmark for MGT\ndetection. We define three editing tasks, empirically grounded in Wikipedia\neditors' perceived use cases for LLM-assisted editing: Paragraph Writing,\nSummarisation, and Text Style Transfer, which we implement using two new\ndatasets across three languages. For each writing task, we evaluate three\nprompts, generate MGT across multiple generators using the best-performing\nprompt, and benchmark diverse detectors. We find that, across settings,\ntraining-based detectors achieve an average accuracy of 78%, while zero-shot\ndetectors average 58%. These results show that detectors struggle with MGT in\nrealistic generation scenarios and underscore the importance of evaluating such\nmodels on diverse, task-specific data to assess their reliability in\neditor-driven contexts.",

In particular, when CPU memory is\nleveraged to temporarily store intermediate states of LLMs, CPU memory becomes\na new bottleneck and soon reaches the capacity limitation of commodity CPUs. In\nthis work, we investigate the effectiveness of Compute Express Link (CXL)\nadd-in card (AIC) memory as an extension to CPU memory, enabling larger model\nsizes and longer context lengths during fine-tuning. Through extensive\nbenchmarking, this study quantifies the performance overhead introduced by\ntransferring data between CXL memory, CPU, and GPUs, focusing on how\nconcurrency and data volume influence bandwidth utilization and latency. This\nstudy also compares CPUbased optimizer steps when model parameters, gradients,\nand optimizer states reside in local memory versus CXL memory, revealing that\nnaive adoption of CXL often degrades performance during the optimizer phase. To\novercome these challenges, this study proposes a CXL-aware allocation to\nstrategically partition CPU offloading workloads across both local and CXL\nmemory. This study further demonstrates that employing multiple AICs\nsignificantly reduces bandwidth contention, thus improving scalability.\nExperimental results show that these optimizations enable efficient\nlong-context LLM fine-tuning, underscoring CXL as a promising avenue for\nunlocking the full potential of CPU offloading in long-context LLM fine-tuning.",

In long-term planning tasks,\nhowever, errors tend to accumulate, often leading to unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior, limiting their use in general-purpose settings. We propose a modular\nactor-critic architecture in which an LLM actor is guided by LTLCrit, a\ntrajectory-level LLM critic that communicates via linear temporal logic (LTL).\nOur setup combines the reasoning strengths of language models with the\nguarantees of formal logic. The actor selects high-level actions from natural\nlanguage observations, while the critic analyzes full trajectories and proposes\nnew LTL constraints that shield the actor from future unsafe or inefficient\nbehavior. The architecture supports both fixed, hand-specified safety\nconstraints and adaptive, learned soft constraints that promote long-term\nefficiency. Our architecture is model-agnostic: any LLM-based planner can serve\nas the actor, and LTLCrit serves as a logic-generating wrapper. We formalize\nplanning as graph traversal under symbolic constraints, allowing LTLCrit to\nanalyze failed or suboptimal trajectories and generate new temporal logic rules\nthat improve future behavior. We evaluate our system on the Minecraft\ndiamond-mining benchmark, achieving 100% completion rates and improving\nefficiency compared to baseline LLM planners.

Mainstream protection mechanisms leverage trusted\nexecution environments (TEEs) where confidentiality and integrity for secretive\ndata are shielded using hardware-based encryption and integrity checking.\nUnfortunately, running model inference entirely within TEEs is subject to\nnon-trivial slowdown, which is further exacerbated in LLMs due to the\nsubstantial computation and memory footprint involved. Recent studies reveal\nthat the hybrid TEE-based scheme offloading partial model inference operations\nto the untrusted accelerators (e.g., GPU) is a promising solution. However,\nprior offloading schemes fail to ensure dual protection of data and model in\nTransformer inference, as they cannot securely offload critical operations,\ni.e., Attention and SoftMax, forcing these computations to remain confined\nwithin TEEs. To address these challenges, we propose TwinShield, a framework\nenabling secure Transformer inference in heterogeneous TEE and accelerator\nsystems with dual protection for both model and data.

This paper presents a systematic\ninvestigation into this issue. Through comprehensive ablation studies on state\nof the art multi encoder MLLMs, we empirically demonstrate that significant\nredundancy exists. To quantify each encoder's unique contribution, we propose a\nprincipled metric: the Conditional Utilization Rate (CUR). Building on CUR, we\nintroduce the Information Gap (IG) to capture the overall disparity in encoder\nutility within a model.Our experiments reveal that certain vision encoders\ncontribute little, or even negatively, to overall performance, confirming\nsubstantial redundancy.

However, existing structured\nprompting strategies are typically limited to single-agent, plan-only settings,\nand often evaluate performance solely based on task accuracy - overlooking\ncritical factors such as token efficiency, modularity, and scalability in\nmulti-agent environments.

This design transforms loosely connected agent plans into\ncohesive, interpretable, and verifiable multi-agent reasoning programs.

Leveraging a natural experiment result\nfrom the platform's sudden rollout of location tagging on April 28, 2022, we\ncompare millions of time-stamped observations of user behavior in the comment\nsections of these accounts before and after the policy change. Although the\npolicy appeared intended to deter overseas users from spreading information\ndeemed harmful by the regime, we find no reduction in their engagement.\nInstead, the policy sharply reduced domestic users' willingness to comment on\nposts about local issues outside their own provinces. This effect was\nespecially pronounced among out-of-province commenters and disproportionately\ncurtailed criticisms. Using large language models, we further show that\nlocation disclosure triggered a rise in regionally discriminatory replies,\nwhich in turn heightened the perceived risk of cross-provincial engagement and\nreshaped the norms of online participation. Our findings suggest that\nauthoritarian regimes can reinforce censorship not only through top-down\ncontrol, but by mobilizing social cleavages, here, regional divisions, to\nsuppress dissent and fragment public discourse.",

    "title": "Efficient Knowledge Graph Construction and Retrieval from Unstructured\n  Text for Large-Scale RAG Systems",
    "summary": "We propose a scalable and cost-efficient framework for deploying Graph-based\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) in enterprise environments. While\nGraphRAG has shown promise for multi-hop reasoning and structured retrieval,\nits adoption has been limited by the high computational cost of constructing\nknowledge graphs using large language models (LLMs) and the latency of\ngraph-based retrieval. To address these challenges, we introduce two core\ninnovations: (1) a dependency-based knowledge graph construction pipeline that\nleverages industrial-grade NLP libraries to extract entities and relations from\nunstructured text completely eliminating reliance on LLMs; and (2) a\nlightweight graph retrieval strategy that combines hybrid query node\nidentification with efficient one-hop traversal for high-recall, low-latency\nsubgraph extraction. We evaluate our framework on two SAP datasets focused on\nlegacy code migration and demonstrate strong empirical performance. Our system\nachieves up to 15% and 4.35% improvements over traditional RAG baselines based\non LLM-as-Judge and RAGAS metrics, respectively. Moreover, our dependency-based\nconstruction approach attains 94% of the performance of LLM-generated knowledge\ngraphs (61.87% vs. 65.83%) while significantly reducing cost and improving\nscalability. These results validate the feasibility of deploying GraphRAG\nsystems in real-world, large-scale enterprise applications without incurring\nprohibitive resource requirements paving the way for practical, explainable,\nand domain-adaptable retrieval-augmented reasoning.",

    "summary": "Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) allows model builders to capture the\ntask specific parameters into adapters, which are a fraction of the size of the\noriginal base model. Popularity of PEFT technique for fine-tuning has led to\ncreation of a large number of adapters for popular Large Language Models\n(LLMs). However, existing frameworks fall short in supporting inference or\nfine-tuning with multiple adapters in the following ways. 1) For fine-tuning,\neach job needs to deploy its dedicated base model instance, which results in\nexcessive GPU memory consumption and poor GPU utilization. 2) While popular\ninference platforms can serve multiple PEFT adapters, they do not allow\nindependent resource management or mixing of different PEFT methods. 3) They\ncannot share resources (such as base model instance) between inference and\nfine-tuning jobs. 4) They do not provide privacy to users who may not wish to\nexpose their fine-tuned parameters to service providers. In Symbiosis, we\naddress the above problems by enabling as-a-service deployment of base model.\nThe base model layers can be shared across multiple inference or fine-tuning\nprocesses. Our split-execution technique decouples the execution of\nclient-specific adapters and layers from the frozen base model layers offering\nthem flexibility to manage their resources, to select their fine-tuning method,\nto achieve their performance goals. Our approach is transparent to models and\nworks out-of-the-box for most models in the transformers library.

    "summary": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) remains resource-intensive due to\ntheir sheer scale. While zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a\nmemory-efficient alternative by eliminating backward passes, its application to\nmulti-hundred-billion-parameter models is constrained by GPU memory and compute\nthroughput. The ZO2 framework addresses the memory bottleneck by offloading\nmodel parameters to CPU memory and overlapping transformer block transfer with\ndual forward computation on a single GPU. However, ZO2 remains limited by its\nsingle-device execution and achieves modest throughput. In this work, we\npresent DistZO2, a high-throughput, memory-efficient framework for distributed\nzeroth-order fine-tuning of LLMs. DistZO2 introduces three parallel strategies:\n(1) Perturbation Parallelism (PertP), which parallelizes the two perturbed\nforward passes across devices; (2) Distributed Data Parallelism (DDP), adapted\nto the scalar-gradient nature of ZO training; and (3) a unified 2D Parallelism\ndesign that combines PertP and DDP. To further mitigate communication\nbottlenecks introduced by parameter offloading, we propose a hardware-aware\ncommunication strategy that slices parameter blocks and redistributes them\nacross GPUs via high-speed interconnects such as NVLink. DistZO2 scales\nzeroth-order fine-tuning to modern multi-GPU systems, preserving ZO2's memory\nefficiency while substantially improving training throughput. In our\nexperiments on OPT-175B, DistZO2 achieves a 3x speedup over ZO2 with\ndistributed computing. DistZO2's code has been open-sourced in\nhttps://github.com/liangyuwang/zo2.",

    "title": "The Impact of LLM-Assistants on Software Developer Productivity: A\n  Systematic Literature Review",
    "summary": "Large language model assistants (LLM-assistants) present new opportunities to\ntransform software development. Developers are increasingly adopting these\ntools across tasks, including coding, testing, debugging, documentation, and\ndesign. Yet, despite growing interest, there is no synthesis of how\nLLM-assistants affect software developer productivity. In this paper, we\npresent a systematic literature review of 37 peer-reviewed studies published\nbetween January 2014 and December 2024 that examine this impact. Our analysis\nreveals that LLM-assistants offer both considerable benefits and critical\nrisks. Commonly reported gains include minimized code search, accelerated\ndevelopment, and the automation of trivial and repetitive tasks. However,\nstudies also highlight concerns around cognitive offloading, reduced team\ncollaboration, and inconsistent effects on code quality. While the majority of\nstudies (92%) adopt a multi-dimensional perspective by examining at least two\nSPACE dimensions, reflecting increased awareness of the complexity of developer\nproductivity, only 14% extend beyond three dimensions, indicating substantial\nroom for more integrated evaluations. Satisfaction, Performance, and Efficiency\nare the most frequently investigated dimensions, whereas Communication and\nActivity remain underexplored. Most studies are exploratory (64%) and\nmethodologically diverse, but lack longitudinal and team-based evaluations.\nThis review surfaces key research gaps and provides recommendations for future\nresearch and practice.

While existing approaches offload\nKV caches to CPU memory or apply sparse attention to reduce GPU load, they\noften underutilize CPU compute resources and compromise accuracy. We present\nHGCA, a hybrid CPU-GPU attention mechanism that enables scalable,\nhigh-throughput LLM inference with near-full attention quality. HGCA performs\ndense attention on recently generated KV entries retained in GPU memory and\nparallel sparse attention on selected, salient KV entries in CPU memory.

HGCA also introduces a finegrained, per-head\nsparsification strategy optimized for CPU execution, preserving contextual\nrelevance while reducing computation. Our implementation seamlessly integrates\ninto existing LLM frameworks without requiring model retraining. Experiments\nacross diverse models and workloads show that HGCA achieves superior\nscalability, supports longer sequences and larger batch sizes, and outperforms\nexisting sparse attention baselines in both performance and accuracy -- all on\ncommodity GPU hardware.",

    "summary": "The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP), enabling performance across diverse tasks with\nlittle task-specific training. However, LLMs remain susceptible to social\nbiases, particularly reflecting harmful stereotypes from training data, which\ncan disproportionately affect marginalised communities. We measure gender bias\nin Maltese LMs, arguing that such bias is harmful as it reinforces societal\nstereotypes and fails to account for gender diversity, which is especially\nproblematic in gendered, low-resource languages. While bias evaluation and\nmitigation efforts have progressed for English-centric models, research on\nlow-resourced and morphologically rich languages remains limited. This research\ninvestigates the transferability of debiasing methods to Maltese language\nmodels, focusing on BERTu and mBERTu, BERT-based monolingual and multilingual\nmodels respectively.

    "summary": "Although demonstrating remarkable performance on reasoning tasks, Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) still tend to fabricate unreliable responses when\nconfronted with problems that are unsolvable or beyond their capability,\nseverely undermining the reliability. Prior studies of LLM reliability have\nprimarily focused on knowledge tasks to identify unanswerable questions, while\nmathematical reasoning tasks have remained unexplored due to the dearth of\nunsolvable math problems. To systematically investigate LLM reliability in\nmathematical reasoning tasks, we formulate the reliability evaluation for both\nsolvable and unsolvable problems. We then develop a ReliableMath dataset which\nincorporates open-source solvable problems and high-quality unsolvable problems\nsynthesized by our proposed construction workflow with human evaluations.\nExperiments are conducted on various LLMs with several key findings uncovered.\nLLMs fail to directly identify unsolvable problems and always generate\nfabricated responses. When instructing LLMs to indicate unsolvability using a\nreliable prompt, the reliability of larger-sized LLMs remains on solvable\nproblems, but notably improves on unsolvable problems yet still falls short of\nsolvable problems. However, small LLMs rarely show any progress despite\nemploying reliable prompts. Therefore, we further propose an alignment strategy\nto enhance small LLMs' reliability, which can significantly improve LLM\nreliability performances on both in-domain and out-of-domain tasks.",

Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training\nor fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable\npipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron\n(MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and\ndeployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly\nsuited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both\ncentralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly\navailable embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard\nand three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and\nICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits\nassess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially\noutweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that\nfederated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized\nconditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than\nstate-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1\nscores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the\nsimplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way\ntoward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step\ntoward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI.",

To investigate this\napparent paradox, we developed a novel experimental paradigm, exploiting the\nunique ability to obtain confidence estimates from LLMs without creating memory\nof their initial judgments -- something impossible in human participants. We\nshow that LLMs -- Gemma 3, GPT4o and o1-preview -- exhibit a pronounced\nchoice-supportive bias that reinforces and boosts their estimate of confidence\nin their answer, resulting in a marked resistance to change their mind. We\nfurther demonstrate that LLMs markedly overweight inconsistent compared to\nconsistent advice, in a fashion that deviates qualitatively from normative\nBayesian updating. Finally, we demonstrate that these two mechanisms -- a drive\nto maintain consistency with prior commitments and hypersensitivity to\ncontradictory feedback -- parsimoniously capture LLM behavior in a different\ndomain. Together, these findings furnish a mechanistic account of LLM\nconfidence that explains both their stubbornness and excessive sensitivity to\ncriticism.",

    "summary": "With the emergence of strong visual-language capabilities, multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) have demonstrated tremendous potential for real-world\napplications. However, the security vulnerabilities exhibited by the visual\nmodality pose significant challenges to deploying such models in open-world\nenvironments. Recent studies have successfully induced harmful responses from\ntarget MLLMs by encoding harmful textual semantics directly into visual inputs.\nHowever, in these approaches, the visual modality primarily serves as a trigger\nfor unsafe behavior, often exhibiting semantic ambiguity and lacking grounding\nin realistic scenarios. In this work, we define a novel setting: visual-centric\njailbreak, where visual information serves as a necessary component in\nconstructing a complete and realistic jailbreak context. Building on this\nsetting, we propose the VisCo (Visual Contextual) Attack. VisCo fabricates\ncontextual dialogue using four distinct visual-focused strategies, dynamically\ngenerating auxiliary images when necessary to construct a visual-centric\njailbreak scenario. To maximize attack effectiveness, it incorporates automatic\ntoxicity obfuscation and semantic refinement to produce a final attack prompt\nthat reliably triggers harmful responses from the target black-box MLLMs.\nSpecifically, VisCo achieves a toxicity score of 4.78 and an Attack Success\nRate (ASR) of 85% on MM-SafetyBench against GPT-4o, significantly outperforming\nthe baseline, which performs a toxicity score of 2.48 and an ASR of 22.2%.

    "title": "LLM-Driven Treatment Effect Estimation Under Inference Time Text\n  Confounding",
    "summary": "Estimating treatment effects is crucial for personalized decision-making in\nmedicine, but this task faces unique challenges in clinical practice. At\ntraining time, models for estimating treatment effects are typically trained on\nwell-structured medical datasets that contain detailed patient information.\nHowever, at inference time, predictions are often made using textual\ndescriptions (e.g., descriptions with self-reported symptoms), which are\nincomplete representations of the original patient information. In this work,\nwe make three contributions. (1) We show that the discrepancy between the data\navailable during training time and inference time can lead to biased estimates\nof treatment effects. We formalize this issue as an inference time text\nconfounding problem, where confounders are fully observed during training time\nbut only partially available through text at inference time. (2) To address\nthis problem, we propose a novel framework for estimating treatment effects\nthat explicitly accounts for inference time text confounding. Our framework\nleverages large language models together with a custom doubly robust learner to\nmitigate biases caused by the inference time text confounding. (3) Through a\nseries of experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in\nreal-world applications.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) is a promising approach\nfor improving the complex reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs).\nHowever, current RLVR methods face two significant challenges: the near-miss\nreward problem, where a small mistake can invalidate an otherwise correct\nreasoning process, greatly hindering training efficiency; and exploration\nstagnation, where models tend to focus on solutions within their ``comfort\nzone,'' lacking the motivation to explore potentially more effective\nalternatives. To address these challenges, we propose StepHint, a novel RLVR\nalgorithm that utilizes multi-level stepwise hints to help models explore the\nsolution space more effectively. StepHint generates valid reasoning chains from\nstronger models and partitions these chains into reasoning steps using our\nproposed adaptive partitioning method. The initial few steps are used as hints,\nand simultaneously, multiple-level hints (each comprising a different number of\nsteps) are provided to the model. This approach directs the model's exploration\ntoward a promising solution subspace while preserving its flexibility for\nindependent exploration. By providing hints, StepHint mitigates the near-miss\nreward problem, thereby improving training efficiency. Additionally, the\nexternal reasoning pathways help the model develop better reasoning abilities,\nenabling it to move beyond its ``comfort zone'' and mitigate exploration\nstagnation. StepHint outperforms competitive RLVR enhancement methods across\nsix mathematical benchmarks, while also demonstrating superior generalization\nand excelling over baselines on out-of-domain benchmarks.",

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models have been driven by reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-style post-training, which improves reasoning by optimizing model\noutputs based on reward or preference signals. GRPO-style approaches implement\nthis by using self-generated samples labeled by an outcome-based verifier.\nHowever, these methods depend heavily on the model's initial ability to produce\npositive samples. They primarily refine what the model already knows\n(distribution sharpening) rather than enabling the model to solve problems\nwhere it initially fails. This limitation is especially problematic in\nearly-stage RL training and on challenging reasoning tasks, where positive\nsamples are unlikely to be generated. To unlock reasoning ability in such\nsettings, the model must explore new reasoning trajectories beyond its current\noutput distribution. Such exploration requires access to sufficiently good\npositive samples to guide the learning. While expert demonstrations seem like a\nnatural solution, we find that they are often ineffective in RL post-training.\nInstead, we identify two key properties of effective positive samples: they\nshould (1) be likely under the current policy, and (2) increase the model's\nlikelihood of predicting the correct answer. Based on these insights, we\npropose $\\textbf{Self-Explanation Policy Optimization (ExPO)}$-a simple and\nmodular framework that generates such samples by conditioning on the\nground-truth answer. ExPO enables efficient exploration and guides the model to\nproduce reasoning trajectories more aligned with its policy than expert-written\nCoTs, while ensuring higher quality than its own (incorrect) samples.\nExperiments show that ExPO improves both learning efficiency and final\nperformance on reasoning benchmarks, surpassing expert-demonstration-based\nmethods in challenging settings such as MATH level-5, where the model initially\nstruggles the most.",

    "summary": "With the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in practical\napplications, selecting an appropriate model requires balancing not only\nperformance but also operational cost. The emergence of reasoning-capable\nmodels has further widened the cost gap between \"thinking\" (high reasoning) and\n\"non-thinking\" (fast, low-cost) modes. In this work, we reveal that\napproximately 58% of medical questions can be accurately answered by the\nnon-thinking mode alone, without requiring the high-cost reasoning process.\nThis highlights a clear dichotomy in problem complexity and suggests that\ndynamically routing queries to the appropriate mode based on complexity could\noptimize accuracy, cost-efficiency, and overall user experience. Based on this,\nwe further propose SynapseRoute, a machine learning-based dynamic routing\nframework that intelligently assigns input queries to either thinking or\nnon-thinking modes. Experimental results on several medical datasets\ndemonstrate that SynapseRoute not only improves overall accuracy (0.8390 vs.\n0.8272) compared to the thinking mode alone but also reduces inference time by\n36.8% and token consumption by 39.66%. Importantly, qualitative analysis\nindicates that over-reasoning on simpler queries can lead to unnecessary delays\nand even decreased accuracy, a pitfall avoided by our adaptive routing.\nFinally, this work further introduces the Accuracy-Inference-Token (AIT) index\nto comprehensively evaluate the trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and token\ncost.",

    "summary": "For years, semantic interoperability standards have sought to streamline the\nexchange of clinical data, yet their deployment remains time-consuming,\nresource-intensive, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce\na semi-automated approach that leverages large language models specifically\nGPT-4o and Llama 3.2 405b to convert structured clinical datasets into HL7 FHIR\nformat while assessing accuracy, reliability, and security. Applying our method\nto the MIMIC-IV database, we combined embedding techniques, clustering\nalgorithms, and semantic retrieval to craft prompts that guide the models in\nmapping each tabular field to its corresponding FHIR resource. In an initial\nbenchmark, resource identification achieved a perfect F1-score, with GPT-4o\noutperforming Llama 3.2 thanks to the inclusion of FHIR resource schemas within\nthe prompt. Under real-world conditions, accuracy dipped slightly to 94 %, but\nrefinements to the prompting strategy restored robust mappings. Error analysis\nrevealed occasional hallucinations of non-existent attributes and mismatches in\ngranularity, which more detailed prompts can mitigate. Overall, our study\ndemonstrates the feasibility of context-aware, LLM-driven transformation of\nclinical data into HL7 FHIR, laying the groundwork for semi-automated\ninteroperability workflows.

However, enabling\nsuch collaboration becomes challenging when transient devices need to interact\nwith host devices in temporarily visited environments. In such cases,\nfine-grained access control policies are necessary to ensure secure\ninteractions; however, manually implementing them is often impractical for\nnon-expert users. Moreover, at run-time, the system must automatically\nconfigure the devices and enforce such fine-grained access control rules.\nAdditionally, the system must address the heterogeneity of devices.\n  In this paper, we present CollabIoT, a system that enables secure and\nseamless device collaboration in transient IoT environments. CollabIoT employs\na Large language Model (LLM)-driven approach to convert users' high-level\nintents to fine-grained access control policies. To support secure and seamless\ndevice collaboration, CollabIoT adopts capability-based access control for\nauthorization and uses lightweight proxies for policy enforcement, providing\nhardware-independent abstractions.\n  We implement a prototype of CollabIoT's policy generation and auto\nconfiguration pipelines and evaluate its efficacy on an IoT testbed and in\nlarge-scale emulated environments. We show that our LLM-based policy generation\npipeline is able to generate functional and correct policies with 100%\naccuracy.

Our approach\nincorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative\nsummarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic\nunderstanding of the video content.

To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel\nbenchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500\nprofessionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both\ngeneral and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the\nquality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.",

    "summary": "We introduce DeSTA2.5-Audio, a general-purpose Large Audio Language Model\n(LALM) designed for robust auditory perception and instruction-following,\nwithout requiring task-specific audio instruction-tuning. Recent LALMs\ntypically augment Large Language Models (LLMs) with auditory capabilities by\ntraining on large-scale, manually curated or LLM-synthesized audio-instruction\ndatasets. However, these approaches have often suffered from the catastrophic\nforgetting of the LLM's original language abilities. To address this, we\nrevisit the data construction pipeline and propose DeSTA, a self-generated\ncross-modal alignment strategy in which the backbone LLM generates its own\ntraining targets. This approach preserves the LLM's native language proficiency\nwhile establishing effective audio-text alignment, thereby enabling zero-shot\ngeneralization without task-specific tuning. Using DeSTA, we construct\nDeSTA-AQA5M, a large-scale, task-agnostic dataset containing 5 million training\nsamples derived from 7,000 hours of audio spanning 50 diverse datasets,\nincluding speech, environmental sounds, and music. DeSTA2.5-Audio achieves\nstate-of-the-art or competitive performance across a wide range of\naudio-language benchmarks, including Dynamic-SUPERB, MMAU, SAKURA,\nSpeech-IFEval, and VoiceBench. Comprehensive comparative studies demonstrate\nthat our self-generated strategy outperforms widely adopted data construction\nand training strategies in both auditory perception and instruction-following\ncapabilities. Our findings underscore the importance of carefully designed data\nconstruction in LALM development and offer practical insights for building\nrobust, general-purpose LALMs.",

KPE shifts the focus from merely augmenting LLMs with fragmented\ninformation to endowing them with a domain's intrinsic logic, operational\nstrategies, and methodological principles. We argue that a well-engineered\nKnowledge Protocol allows a generalist LLM to function as a specialist, capable\nof decomposing abstract queries and executing complex, multi-step tasks.

    "summary": "Recent work has shown that training loss scales as a power law with both\nmodel size and the number of tokens, and that achieving compute-optimal models\nrequires scaling model size and token count together. However, these scaling\nlaws assume an infinite supply of data and apply primarily in compute-bound\nsettings. As modern large language models increasingly rely on massive\ninternet-scale datasets, the assumption that they are compute-bound is becoming\nless valid. This shift highlights the need for architectures that prioritize\ntoken efficiency.\n  In this work, we investigate the use of the 2-simplicial Transformer, an\narchitecture that generalizes standard dot-product attention to trilinear\nfunctions through an efficient Triton kernel implementation. We demonstrate\nthat the 2-simplicial Transformer achieves better token efficiency than\nstandard Transformers: for a fixed token budget, similarly sized models\noutperform their dot-product counterparts on tasks involving mathematics,\ncoding, reasoning, and logic. We quantify these gains by demonstrating that\n$2$-simplicial attention changes the exponent in the scaling laws for knowledge\nand reasoning tasks compared to dot product attention.",

We focus on two types of steganography:\npassing encoded messages and performing encoded reasoning. We find that current\nmodels are unable to encode short messages in their outputs without a monitor\nnoticing under standard affordances. They can succeed, however, if given\nadditional affordances such as using an unmonitored scratchpad and coordinating\non what encoding scheme to use. We additionally find early signs that models\ncan perform basic encoded reasoning in a simple state-tracking problem. This\nincludes some ability to reason with their own and pre-defined schemes,\nincluding encoding schemes such as Hexadecimal. Despite this, they can rarely\nhide reasoning subtly within a cover task to fool a monitor.

To address such black-box network\nmanagement tasks, the large language model (LLM) optimizer framework, which\nleverages pretrained LLMs as optimization agents, has recently been promoted as\na promising solution. This framework utilizes natural language prompts\ndescribing the given optimization problems along with past solutions generated\nby LLMs themselves. As a result, LLMs can obtain efficient solutions\nautonomously without knowing the mathematical models of the objective\nfunctions. Although the viability of the LLM optimizer (LLMO) framework has\nbeen studied in various black-box scenarios, it has so far been limited to\nnumerical simulations. For the first time, this paper establishes a theoretical\nfoundation for the LLMO framework. With careful investigations of LLM inference\nsteps, we can interpret the LLMO procedure as a finite-state Markov chain, and\nprove the convergence of the framework. Our results are extended to a more\nadvanced multiple LLM architecture, where the impact of multiple LLMs is\nrigorously verified in terms of the convergence rate.

    "summary": "Integrating third-party software components is a common practice in modern\nsoftware development, offering significant advantages in terms of efficiency\nand innovation. However, this practice is fraught with risks related to\nsoftware licensing. A lack of understanding may lead to disputes, which can\npose serious legal and operational challenges. To these ends, both academia and\nindustry have conducted various investigations and proposed solutions and tools\nto deal with these challenges. However, significant limitations still remain.\nMoreover, the rapid evolution of open-source software (OSS) licenses, as well\nas the rapidly incorporated generative software engineering techniques, such as\nlarge language models for code (CodeLLMs), are placing greater demands on the\nsystematic management of software license risks. To unveil the severe\nchallenges and explore possible future directions, we conduct the first\nsystematic literature review (SLR) on 80 carefully selected OSS license-related\npapers, classifying existing research into three key categories, i.e., license\nidentification, license risk assessment, and license risk mitigation. Based on\nthese, we discuss challenges in existing solutions, conclude the opportunities\nto shed light on future research directions and offer practical recommendations\nfor practitioners. We hope this thorough review will help bridge the gaps\nbetween academia and industry and accelerate the ecosystem-wide governance of\nlegitimate software risks within the software engineering community.",

    "summary": "Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological\nstudies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The\nreliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR\ndata. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including\nmisrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they\nare primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality\nassessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess\ndata fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit\ntesting and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data\nquality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking\nTool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test\ngenerator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a\ntest suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework\nthat executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and\nSyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These\ntests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We\npresent a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of\nreference grounding and value accuracy.\n  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable\ncontext-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to\nimprove the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges\nfrom a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further\ndevelopment such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods.",

    "summary": "Distributed inference serves as a promising approach to enabling the\ninference of large language models (LLMs) at the network edge. It distributes\nthe inference process to multiple devices to ensure that the LLMs can fit into\nthe device memory. Recent pipeline-based approaches have the potential to\nparallelize communication and computation, which helps reduce inference\nlatency. However, the benefit diminishes when the inference request at the\nnetwork edge is sparse, where pipeline is typically at low utilization. To\nenable efficient distributed LLM inference at the edge, we propose\n\\textbf{FlowSpec}, a pipeline-parallel tree-based speculative decoding\nframework. FlowSpec incorporates three key mechanisms to improve decoding\nefficiency: 1) score-based step-wise verification prioritizes more important\ndraft tokens to bring earlier accpeted tokens; 2) efficient draft management to\nprune invalid tokens while maintaining correct causal relationship during\nverification; 3) dynamic draft expansion strategies to supply high-quality\nspeculative inputs. These techniques work in concert to enhance both pipeline\nutilization and speculative efficiency. We evaluate FlowSpec on a real-world\ntestbed with other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our\nproposed framework significantly improves inference speed across diverse models\nand configurations, achieving speedup ratios 1.28$\\times$-1.79$\\times$ compared\nto baselines.

Furthermore, they\nexhibit distinctive and persistent \"strategic fingerprints\": Google's Gemini\nmodels proved strategically ruthless, exploiting cooperative opponents and\nretaliating against defectors, while OpenAI's models remained highly\ncooperative, a trait that proved catastrophic in hostile environments.\nAnthropic's Claude emerged as the most forgiving reciprocator, showing\nremarkable willingness to restore cooperation even after being exploited or\nsuccessfully defecting. Analysis of nearly 32,000 prose rationales provided by\nthe models reveals that they actively reason about both the time horizon and\ntheir opponent's likely strategy, and we demonstrate that this reasoning is\ninstrumental to their decisions.

This\noverlooks human label variation (HLV), the occurrence of plausible differences\nin annotations, as an informative signal.

While its effects on training\nstability are well documented, its role at inference time is poorly understood.\nAdditionally, LN layers hinder mechanistic interpretability by introducing\nadditional nonlinearities and increasing the interconnectedness of individual\nmodel components. Here, we show that all LN layers can be removed from every\nGPT-2 model with only a small increase in validation loss (e.g. +0.03\ncross-entropy loss for GPT-2 XL). Thus, LN cannot play a substantial role in\nlanguage modeling. We find that the amount of fine-tuning data needed for LN\nremoval grows sublinearly with model parameters, suggesting scaling to larger\nmodels is feasible. We release a suite of LN-free GPT-2 models on Hugging Face.\nFurthermore, we test interpretability techniques on LN-free models. Direct\nlogit attribution now gives the exact direct effect of individual components,\nwhile the accuracy of attribution patching does not significantly improve. We\nalso confirm that GPT-2's \"confidence neurons\" are inactive in the LN-free\nmodels.

In this work, we\npresent an extensive study aimed at advancing recent RL-based finetuning\ntechniques for LLMs in the context of vulnerability detection.\n  We start by highlighting key limitations of commonly adopted LLMs, such as\ntheir tendency to over-predict certain types of vulnerabilities while failing\nto detect others. To address this challenge, we explore the use of Group\nRelative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a recent policy-gradient method, for\nguiding LLM behavior through structured, rule-based rewards. We enable its\napplication to the vulnerability detection task by redefining its advantage\nfunctions and reward signals using annotations from widely used datasets in the\nfield, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and CleanVul.\n  The proposed methodology enables an extensive set of experiments, addressing\nmultiple research questions regarding the impact of GRPO on generalization,\nreasoning capabilities, and performance improvements over standard supervised\nfinetuning (SFT).

    "summary": "Fairness--the absence of unjustified bias--is a core principle in the\ndevelopment of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, yet it remains difficult\nto assess and enforce. Current approaches to fairness testing in large language\nmodels (LLMs) often rely on manual evaluation, fixed templates, deterministic\nheuristics, and curated datasets, making them resource-intensive and difficult\nto scale. This work aims to lay the groundwork for a novel, automated method\nfor testing fairness in LLMs, reducing the dependence on domain-specific\nresources and broadening the applicability of current approaches. Our approach,\nMeta-Fair, is based on two key ideas. First, we adopt metamorphic testing to\nuncover bias by examining how model outputs vary in response to controlled\nmodifications of input prompts, defined by metamorphic relations (MRs). Second,\nwe propose exploiting the potential of LLMs for both test case generation and\noutput evaluation, leveraging their capability to generate diverse inputs and\nclassify outputs effectively. The proposal is complemented by three open-source\ntools supporting LLM-driven generation, execution, and evaluation of test\ncases. We report the findings of several experiments involving 12 pre-trained\nLLMs, 14 MRs, 5 bias dimensions, and 7.9K automatically generated test cases.\nThe results show that Meta-Fair is effective in uncovering bias in LLMs,\nachieving an average precision of 92% and revealing biased behaviour in 29% of\nexecutions. Additionally, LLMs prove to be reliable and consistent evaluators,\nwith the best-performing models achieving F1-scores of up to 0.79. Although\nnon-determinism affects consistency, these effects can be mitigated through\ncareful MR design. While challenges remain to ensure broader applicability, the\nresults indicate a promising path towards an unprecedented level of automation\nin LLM testing.",

In this work, we\nintroduce a unified agentic framework that leverages large language models\n(LLMs) for both discrete fault-recovery planning and continuous process control\nwithin a single architecture. We adopt Finite State Machines (FSMs) as\ninterpretable operating envelopes: an LLM-driven planning agent proposes\nrecovery sequences through the FSM, a Simulation Agent executes and checks each\ntransition, and a Validator-Reprompting loop iteratively refines invalid plans.\nIn Case Study 1, across 180 randomly generated FSMs of varying sizes (4-25\nstates, 4-300 transitions), GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini achieve 100% valid-path\nsuccess within five reprompts-outperforming open-source LLMs in both accuracy\nand latency. In Case Study 2, the same framework modulates dual-heater inputs\non a laboratory TCLab platform (and its digital twin) to maintain a target\naverage temperature under persistent asymmetric disturbances. Compared to\nclassical PID control, our LLM-based controller attains similar performance,\nwhile ablation of the prompting loop reveals its critical role in handling\nnonlinear dynamics. We analyze key failure modes-such as instruction following\nlapses and coarse ODE approximations.

    "summary": "Recent advances have applied large language models (LLMs) to sequential\nrecommendation, leveraging their pre-training knowledge and reasoning\ncapabilities to provide more personalized user experiences. However, existing\nLLM-based methods fail to sufficiently leverage the rich temporal information\ninherent in users' historical interaction sequences, stemming from fundamental\narchitectural constraints: LLMs process information through self-attention\nmechanisms that lack inherent sequence ordering and rely on position embeddings\ndesigned primarily for natural language rather than user interaction sequences.\nThis limitation significantly impairs their ability to capture the evolution of\nuser preferences over time and predict future interests accurately.\n  To address this critical gap, we propose Counterfactual Enhanced Temporal\nFramework for LLM-Based Recommendation (CETRec). CETRec is grounded in causal\ninference principles, which allow it to isolate and measure the specific impact\nof temporal information on recommendation outcomes. By conceptualizing temporal\norder as an independent causal factor distinct from item content, we can\nquantify its unique contribution through counterfactual reasoning--comparing\nwhat recommendations would be made with and without temporal information while\nkeeping all other factors constant. This causal framing enables CETRec to\ndesign a novel counterfactual tuning objective that directly optimizes the\nmodel's temporal sensitivity, teaching LLMs to recognize both absolute\ntimestamps and relative ordering patterns in user histories. Combined with our\ncounterfactual tuning task derived from causal analysis, CETRec effectively\nenhances LLMs' awareness of both absolute order (how recently items were\ninteracted with) and relative order (the sequential relationships between\nitems).",

    "summary": "Trajectory prediction is an essential step in the pipeline of an autonomous\nvehicle. Inaccurate or inconsistent predictions regarding the movement of\nagents in its surroundings lead to poorly planned maneuvers and potentially\ndangerous situations for the end-user. Current state-of-the-art\ndeep-learning-based trajectory prediction models can achieve excellent accuracy\non public datasets. However, when used in more complex, interactive scenarios,\nthey often fail to capture important interdependencies between agents, leading\nto inconsistent predictions among agents in the traffic scene. Inspired by the\nefficacy of incorporating human preference into large language models, this\nwork fine-tunes trajectory prediction models in multi-agent settings using\npreference optimization. By taking as input automatically calculated preference\nrankings among predicted futures in the fine-tuning process, our\nexperiments--using state-of-the-art models on three separate datasets--show\nthat we are able to significantly improve scene consistency while minimally\nsacrificing trajectory prediction accuracy and without adding any excess\ncomputational requirements at inference time.",

However, optimizing\ncompound systems remains challenging due to their non-differentiable structures\nand diverse configuration types across components, including prompts,\nhyperparameters, and model parameters. To address this challenge, we propose\nOptimas, a unified framework for effective optimization of compound systems.\nThe core idea of Optimas is to maintain one Local Reward Function (LRF) per\ncomponent, each satisfying a local-global alignment property, i.e., each\ncomponent's local reward correlates with the global system performance. In each\niteration, Optimas efficiently adapts the LRFs to maintain this property while\nsimultaneously maximizing each component's local reward. This approach enables\nindependent updates of heterogeneous configurations using the designated\noptimization method, while ensuring that local improvements consistently lead\nto performance gains. We present extensive evaluations across five real-world\ncompound systems to demonstrate that Optimas outperforms strong baselines by an\naverage improvement of 11.92%, offering a general and effective approach for\nimproving compound systems.

Numerous advanced\nworks based on LLMs have been proposed and applied in various scenarios. Among\nthem, video language models (VidLMs) are particularly widely used. However,\nexisting works primarily focus on terrestrial scenarios, overlooking the highly\ndemanding application needs of underwater observation. To overcome this gap, we\nintroduce UVLM, an under water observation benchmark which is build through a\ncollaborative approach combining human expertise and AI models. To ensure data\nquality, we have conducted in-depth considerations from multiple perspectives.\nFirst, to address the unique challenges of underwater environments, we selected\nvideos that represent typical underwater challenges including light variations,\nwater turbidity, and diverse viewing angles to construct the dataset. Second,\nto ensure data diversity, the dataset covers a wide range of frame rates,\nresolutions, 419 classes of marine animals, and various static plants and\nterrains. Next, for task diversity, we adopted a structured design where\nobservation targets are categorized into two major classes: biological and\nenvironmental. Each category includes content observation and change/action\nobservation, totaling 20 distinct task types. Finally, we designed several\nchallenging evaluation metrics to enable quantitative comparison and analysis\nof different methods. Experiments on two representative VidLMs demonstrate that\nfine-tuning VidLMs on UVLM significantly improves underwater world\nunderstanding while also showing potential for slight improvements on existing\nin-air VidLM benchmarks, such as VideoMME and Perception text.

Notably, recent advances in\npre-trained Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated\nconsiderable potential in enhancing the generalization capabilities of deep\nlearning models. Despite the increasing attention toward VFM-based domain\nprompt tuning within DG, the effective design of prompts capable of\ndisentangling invariant features across diverse domains remains a critical\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose addressing this challenge by leveraging\nthe controllable and flexible language prompt of the VFM. Noting that the text\nmodality of VFMs is naturally easier to disentangle, we introduce a novel\nframework for text feature-guided visual prompt tuning. This framework first\nautomatically disentangles the text prompt using a large language model (LLM)\nand then learns domain-invariant visual representation guided by the\ndisentangled text feature. However, relying solely on language to guide visual\nfeature disentanglement has limitations, as visual features can sometimes be\ntoo complex or nuanced to be fully captured by descriptive text. To address\nthis, we introduce Worst Explicit Representation Alignment (WERA), which\nextends text-guided visual prompts by incorporating an additional set of\nabstract prompts. These prompts enhance source domain diversity through\nstylized image augmentations, while alignment constraints ensure that visual\nrepresentations remain consistent across both the original and augmented\ndistributions. Experiments conducted on major DG datasets, including PACS,\nVLCS, OfficeHome, DomainNet, and TerraInc, demonstrate that our proposed method\noutperforms state-of-the-art DG methods.",

Through a\ndetailed case study of an LLM acting as an HR consultant, we show how its\nadvice, while superficially professional, systematically reinforces\nunproductive problem-solving approaches and blocks pathways to deeper\norganisational learning. This represents a specific instance of the alignment\nproblem where the AI system successfully mirrors human behaviour but inherits\nour cognitive blind spots. This poses particular risks if LLMs are integrated\ninto organisational decision-making processes, potentially entrenching\nanti-learning practices while lending authority to them. The paper concludes by\nexploring the possibility of developing LLMs capable of facilitating Model 2\nlearning - a more productive theory-in-use - and suggests this effort could\nadvance both AI alignment research and action science practice.

    "summary": "Existing visual token compression methods for Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) predominantly operate as post-encoder modules, limiting their\npotential for efficiency gains. To address this limitation, we propose LaCo\n(Layer-wise Visual Token Compression), a novel framework that enables effective\ntoken compression within the intermediate layers of the vision encoder. LaCo\nintroduces two core components: 1) a layer-wise pixel-shuffle mechanism that\nsystematically merges adjacent tokens through space-to-channel transformations,\nand 2) a residual learning architecture with non-parametric shortcuts that\npreserves critical visual information during compression. Extensive experiments\nindicate that our LaCo outperforms all existing methods when compressing tokens\nin the intermediate layers of the vision encoder, demonstrating superior\neffectiveness. In addition, compared to external compression, our method\nimproves training efficiency beyond 20% and inference throughput over 15% while\nmaintaining strong performance.",

However, their suboptimal performance in\nnumerical optimization often yields unsatisfactory reward quality, while the\nevolutionary search paradigm demonstrates inefficient utilization of simulation\nresources, resulting in prohibitively lengthy design cycles with\ndisproportionate computational overhead. To address these challenges, we\npropose the Uncertainty-aware Reward Design Process (URDP), a novel framework\nthat integrates large language models to streamline reward function design and\nevaluation in RL environments. URDP quantifies candidate reward function\nuncertainty based on self-consistency analysis, enabling simulation-free\nidentification of ineffective reward components while discovering novel reward\ncomponents. Furthermore, we introduce uncertainty-aware Bayesian optimization\n(UABO), which incorporates uncertainty estimation to significantly enhance\nhyperparameter configuration efficiency. Finally, we construct a bi-level\noptimization architecture by decoupling the reward component optimization and\nthe hyperparameter tuning. URDP orchestrates synergistic collaboration between\nthe reward logic reasoning of the LLMs and the numerical optimization strengths\nof the Bayesian Optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of URDP\nacross 35 diverse tasks spanning three benchmark environments.

    "summary": "Progress in enhancing large language model (LLM) planning and reasoning\ncapabilities is significantly hampered by the bottleneck of scalable, reliable\ndata generation and evaluation. To overcome this, I introduce NL2FLOW, a fully\nautomated system for parametrically generating planning problems - expressed in\nnatural language, a structured intermediate representation, and formal PDDL -\nand rigorously evaluating the quality of generated plans. I demonstrate\nNL2FLOW's capabilities by generating a dataset of 2296 problems in the\nautomated workflow generation domain and evaluating multiple open-sourced,\ninstruct-tuned LLMs. My results reveal that the highest performing models\nachieved 86% success in generating valid plans and 69% in generating optimal\nplans, specifically for problems with feasible solutions. Regression analysis\nshows that the influence of problem characteristics on plan generation is\ncontingent on both model and prompt design. Notably, I observed that the\nhighest success rate for translating natural language into a JSON\nrepresentation of a plan was lower than the highest rate of generating a valid\nplan directly. This suggests that unnecessarily decomposing the reasoning task\n- introducing intermediate translation steps - may actually degrade\nperformance, implying a benefit to models capable of reasoning directly from\nnatural language to action. As I scale LLM reasoning to increasingly complex\nproblems, the bottlenecks and sources of error within these systems will\ninevitably shift. Therefore, a dynamic understanding of these limitations - and\nthe tools to systematically reveal them - will be crucial for unlocking the\nfull potential of LLMs as intelligent problem solvers.",

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer\npromising solutions, but privacy concerns and computational requirements limit\ntheir adoption in healthcare settings. Objective: To develop and evaluate a\nprivacy-preserving, on-device medical transcription system using a fine-tuned\nLlama 3.2 1B model capable of generating structured medical notes from medical\ntranscriptions while maintaining complete data sovereignty entirely in the\nbrowser. Methods: We fine-tuned a Llama 3.2 1B model using Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) with LoRA on 1,500 synthetic medical\ntranscription-to-structured note pairs. The model was evaluated against the\nbase Llama 3.2 1B on two datasets: 100 endocrinology transcripts and 140\nmodified ACI benchmark cases. Evaluation employed both statistical metrics\n(ROUGE, BERTScore, BLEURT) and LLM-as-judge assessments across multiple\nclinical quality dimensions. Results: The fine-tuned OnDevice model\ndemonstrated substantial improvements over the base model. On the ACI\nbenchmark, ROUGE-1 scores increased from 0.346 to 0.496, while BERTScore F1\nimproved from 0.832 to 0.866. Clinical quality assessments showed marked\nreduction in major hallucinations (from 85 to 35 cases) and enhanced factual\ncorrectness (2.81 to 3.54 on 5-point scale). Similar improvements were observed\non the internal evaluation dataset, with composite scores increasing from 3.13\nto 4.43 (+41.5%). Conclusions: Fine-tuning compact LLMs for medical\ntranscription yields clinically meaningful improvements while enabling complete\non-device browser deployment.

In this paper, we\nfirst investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an\nempirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings\nreveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or\nsemantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to\ndifferentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions)\nand those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical\nregions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time\ndecoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code\ngeneration. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i)\nself-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks\nthem based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining\ndiversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies\ntokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling\ntemperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens\nand higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at\ninference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning. Through\nevaluations on multiple open-source LLMs using the VerilogEval benchmark, we\ndemonstrate significant improvements in syntactic validity, functional\ncorrectness, and output diversity, while the execution overhead (performance\noverhead) is imperceptible.",

We discuss what computer science educators should teach\nin the AI era, how to best integrate these technologies into curricula, and the\nbest practices for assessing student learning in an environment where AI can\ngenerate code, prototypes and user feedback. Finally, we propose a set of\npolicy recommendations designed to harness the potential of generative AI while\npreserving the integrity and rigour of computer science education. Empirical\ndata and emerging studies are used throughout to support our arguments.",

    "title": "Enhancing COBOL Code Explanations: A Multi-Agents Approach Using Large\n  Language Models",
    "summary": "Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) is a programming language used to\ndevelop business applications that are widely adopted by financial, business,\nand government agencies. Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of\nCOBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly\nchallenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for\nnew developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing\nresearch utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of\ncode snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its\narchitectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed\nthe token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach\nthat leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate\nexplanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents\nincorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into\nthe code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach\nusing 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our\napproach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code\nexplanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR,\nchrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach\neffectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token\nwindow size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in\nexplaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated\nexplanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that\nconvey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.",

    "summary": "For over a century, life course researchers have faced a choice between two\ndominant methodological approaches: qualitative methods that analyze rich data\nbut are constrained to small samples, and quantitative survey-based methods\nthat study larger populations but sacrifice data richness for scale. Two recent\ntechnological developments now enable us to imagine a hybrid approach that\ncombines some of the depth of the qualitative approach with the scale of\nquantitative methods. The first development is the steady rise of ''complex log\ndata,'' behavioral data that is logged for purposes other than research but\nthat can be repurposed to construct rich accounts of people's lives. The second\nis the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with exceptional pattern\nrecognition capabilities on plain text. In this paper, we take a necessary step\ntoward creating this hybrid approach by developing a flexible procedure to\ntransform complex log data into a textual representation of an individual's\nlife trajectory across multiple domains, over time, and in context. We call\nthis data representation a ''book of life.'' We illustrate the feasibility of\nour approach by writing over 100 million books of life covering many different\nfacets of life, over time and placed in social context using Dutch\npopulation-scale registry data. We open source the book of life toolkit (BOLT),\nand invite the research community to explore the many potential applications of\nthis approach.",

However, different models often disagree on\nborderline cases, raising concerns about how such disagreement affects\ndownstream retrieval. This study examines labeling disagreement between two\nopen-weight LLMs, LLaMA and Qwen, on a corpus of scholarly abstracts related to\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 3, and 7. We isolate disagreement\nsubsets and examine their lexical properties, rank-order behavior, and\nclassification predictability. Our results show that model disagreement is\nsystematic, not random: disagreement cases exhibit consistent lexical patterns,\nproduce divergent top-ranked outputs under shared scoring functions, and are\ndistinguishable with AUCs above 0.74 using simple classifiers. These findings\nsuggest that LLM-based filtering introduces structured variability in document\nretrieval, even under controlled prompting and shared ranking logic. We propose\nusing classification disagreement as an object of analysis in retrieval\nevaluation, particularly in policy-relevant or thematic search tasks.",

However,\ndeploying LLMs on resource-limited mobile devices faces a significant challenge\ndue to their high demand for computation, memory, and ultimately energy. While\ncurrent LLM frameworks for mobile use three power-hungry components-CPU, GPU,\nand Memory-even when running primarily-GPU LLM models, optimized DVFS governors\nfor CPU, GPU, and memory featured in modern mobile devices operate\nindependently and are oblivious of each other. Motivated by the above\nobservation, in this work, we first measure the energy-efficiency of a SOTA LLM\nframework consisting of various LLM models on mobile phones which showed the\ntriplet mobile governors result in up to 40.4% longer prefilling and decoding\nlatency compared to optimal combinations of CPU, GPU, and memory frequencies\nwith the same energy consumption for sampled prefill and decode lengths.\nSecond, we conduct an in-depth measurement study to uncover how the intricate\ninterplay (or lack of) among the mobile governors cause the above inefficiency\nin LLM inference. Finally, based on these insights, we design FUSE - a unified\nenergy-aware governor for optimizing the energy efficiency of LLM inference on\nmobile devices. Our evaluation using a ShareGPT dataset shows FUSE reduces the\ntime-to-first-token and time-per-output-token latencies by 7.0%-16.9% and\n25.4%-36.8% on average with the same energy-per-token for various mobile LLM\nmodels.",

This perspective paper investigates how\nsuch LLM agents (and societies thereof) can transform the design space of\nrecommender systems.\n  We introduce a unified formalism that (i) models an individual agent as a\ntuple comprising its language core, tool set, and hierarchical memory, and (ii)\ncaptures a multi-agent recommender as a triple of agents, shared environment,\nand communication protocol. Within this framework, we present four end-to-end\nuse cases-interactive party planning, synthetic user-simulation for offline\nevaluation, multi-modal furniture recommendation, and brand-aligned explanation\ngeneration-each illustrating a distinct capability unlocked by agentic\norchestration.\n  We then surface five cross-cutting challenge families: protocol complexity,\nscalability, hallucination and error propagation, emergent misalignment\n(including covert collusion), and brand compliance.\n  For each, we formalize the problem, review nascent mitigation strategies, and\noutline open research questions. The result is both a blueprint and an agenda:\na blueprint that shows how memory-augmented, tool-using LLM agents can be\ncomposed into robust recommendation pipelines, and an agenda inviting the\nRecSys community to develop benchmarks, theoretical guarantees, and governance\ntools that keep pace with this new degree of autonomy. By unifying agentic\nabstractions with recommender objectives, the paper lays the groundwork for the\nnext generation of personalized, trustworthy, and context-rich recommendation\nservices.",

    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to various NLP\ntasks, their inherent biases are gradually disclosed. Therefore, measuring\nbiases in LLMs is crucial to mitigate its ethical risks. However, most existing\nbias evaluation datasets focus on English and North American culture, and their\nbias categories are not fully applicable to other cultures. The datasets\ngrounded in the Chinese language and culture are scarce. More importantly,\nthese datasets usually only support single evaluation tasks and cannot evaluate\nthe bias from multiple aspects in LLMs. To address these issues, we present a\nMulti-task Chinese Bias Evaluation Benchmark (McBE) that includes 4,077 bias\nevaluation instances, covering 12 single bias categories, 82 subcategories and\nintroducing 5 evaluation tasks, providing extensive category coverage, content\ndiversity, and measuring comprehensiveness. Additionally, we evaluate several\npopular LLMs from different series and with parameter sizes. In general, all\nthese LLMs demonstrated varying degrees of bias. We conduct an in-depth\nanalysis of results, offering novel insights into bias in LLMs.",

    "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) in hiring promises to streamline\ncandidate screening, but it also raises serious concerns regarding accuracy and\nalgorithmic bias where sufficient safeguards are not in place. In this work, we\nbenchmark several state-of-the-art foundational LLMs - including models from\nOpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and Deepseek, and compare them with our\nproprietary domain-specific hiring model (Match Score) for job candidate\nmatching. We evaluate each model's predictive accuracy (ROC AUC,\nPrecision-Recall AUC, F1-score) and fairness (impact ratio of cut-off analysis\nacross declared gender, race, and intersectional subgroups). Our experiments on\na dataset of roughly 10,000 real-world recent candidate-job pairs show that\nMatch Score outperforms the general-purpose LLMs on accuracy (ROC AUC 0.85 vs\n0.77) and achieves significantly more equitable outcomes across demographic\ngroups. Notably, Match Score attains a minimum race-wise impact ratio of 0.957\n(near-parity), versus 0.809 or lower for the best LLMs, (0.906 vs 0.773 for the\nintersectionals, respectively). We discuss why pretraining biases may cause\nLLMs with insufficient safeguards to propagate societal biases in hiring\nscenarios, whereas a bespoke supervised model can more effectively mitigate\nthese biases. Our findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modeling\nand bias auditing when deploying AI in high-stakes domains such as hiring, and\ncaution against relying on off-the-shelf LLMs for such tasks without extensive\nfairness safeguards. Furthermore, we show with empirical evidence that there\nshouldn't be a dichotomy between choosing accuracy and fairness in hiring: a\nwell-designed algorithm can achieve both accuracy in hiring and fairness in\noutcomes.",

We benchmark leading proprietary\nLLMs across diverse datasets, highlighting critical trade-offs between\nreasoning performance and token usage.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Kwai Keye-VL}, an\n8-billion-parameter multimodal foundation model engineered for leading-edge\nperformance in short-video understanding while maintaining robust\ngeneral-purpose vision-language abilities. The development of Keye-VL rests on\ntwo core pillars: a massive, high-quality dataset exceeding 600 billion tokens\nwith a strong emphasis on video, and an innovative training recipe. This recipe\nfeatures a four-stage pre-training process for solid vision-language alignment,\nfollowed by a meticulous two-phase post-training process. The first\npost-training stage enhances foundational capabilities like instruction\nfollowing, while the second phase focuses on stimulating advanced reasoning. In\nthis second phase, a key innovation is our five-mode ``cold-start'' data\nmixture, which includes ``thinking'', ``non-thinking'', ``auto-think'', ``think\nwith image'', and high-quality video data. This mixture teaches the model to\ndecide when and how to reason. Subsequent reinforcement learning (RL) and\nalignment steps further enhance these reasoning capabilities and correct\nabnormal model behaviors, such as repetitive outputs. To validate our approach,\nwe conduct extensive evaluations, showing that Keye-VL achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on public video benchmarks and remains highly\ncompetitive on general image-based tasks (Figure 1). Furthermore, we develop\nand release the \\textbf{KC-MMBench}, a new benchmark tailored for real-world\nshort-video scenarios, where Keye-VL shows a significant advantage.",

    "summary": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have transformed natural\nlanguage understanding through vast datasets and large-scale parameterization.\nInspired by this success, we present SpecCLIP, a foundation model framework\nthat extends LLM-inspired methodologies to stellar spectral analysis. Stellar\nspectra, akin to structured language, encode rich physical and chemical\ninformation about stars. By training foundation models on large-scale spectral\ndatasets, our goal is to learn robust and informative embeddings that support\ndiverse downstream applications. As a proof of concept, SpecCLIP involves\npre-training on two spectral types--LAMOST low-resolution and Gaia XP--followed\nby contrastive alignment using the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image\nPre-training) framework, adapted to associate spectra from different\ninstruments. This alignment is complemented by auxiliary decoders that preserve\nspectrum-specific information and enable translation (prediction) between\nspectral types, with the former achieved by maximizing mutual information\nbetween embeddings and input spectra. The result is a cross-spectrum framework\nenabling intrinsic calibration and flexible applications across instruments. We\ndemonstrate that fine-tuning these models on moderate-sized labeled datasets\nimproves adaptability to tasks such as stellar-parameter estimation and\nchemical-abundance determination. SpecCLIP also enhances the accuracy and\nprecision of parameter estimates benchmarked against external survey data.\nAdditionally, its similarity search and cross-spectrum prediction capabilities\noffer potential for anomaly detection. Our results suggest that contrastively\ntrained foundation models enriched with spectrum-aware decoders can advance\nprecision stellar spectroscopy.",

They are being fast deployed as chatbots and evaluators\nin sensitive areas, such as peer review and mental health applications. This,\nalong with the disparate accounts on their reasoning capabilities, calls for a\ncloser examination of LLMs and their comprehension of dialogue. In this work we\nbegin by evaluating LLMs' ability to maintain a debate--one of the purest yet\nmost complex forms of human communication. Then we measure how this capability\nrelates to their understanding of what is being talked about, namely, their\ncomprehension of dialogical structures and the pragmatic context. We find that\nLLMs are capable of maintaining coherent, persuasive debates, often swaying the\nbeliefs of participants and audiences alike. We also note that awareness or\nsuspicion of AI involvement encourage people to be more critical of the\narguments made. When polling LLMs on their comprehension of deeper structures\nof dialogue, however, they cannot demonstrate said understanding. Our findings\ntie the shortcomings of LLMs-as-evaluators to their (in)ability to understand\nthe context. More broadly, for the field of argumentation theory we posit that,\nif an agent can convincingly maintain a dialogue, it is not necessary for it to\nknow what it is talking about.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized mobile\nrobots, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), enabling their intelligent\noperation within Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystems. However, LLMs still face\nchallenges from logical reasoning and complex decision-making, leading to\nconcerns about the reliability of LLM-driven UAV operations in IoT\napplications. In this paper, we propose a LLM-driven closed-loop control\nframework that enables reliable UAV operations powered by effective feedback\nand refinement using two LLM modules, i.e., a Code Generator and an Evaluator.\nOur framework transforms numerical state observations from UAV operations into\nnatural language trajectory descriptions to enhance the evaluator LLM's\nunderstanding of UAV dynamics for precise feedback generation. Our framework\nalso enables a simulation-based refinement process, and hence eliminates the\nrisks to physical UAVs caused by incorrect code execution during the\nrefinement. Extensive experiments on UAV control tasks with different\ncomplexities are conducted. The experimental results show that our framework\ncan achieve reliable UAV operations using LLMs, which significantly outperforms\nbaseline approaches in terms of success rate and completeness with the increase\nof task complexity.",

    "summary": "Instruction-based image editing (IIE) has advanced rapidly with the success\nof diffusion models. However, existing efforts primarily focus on simple and\nexplicit instructions to execute editing operations such as adding, deleting,\nmoving, or swapping objects. They struggle to handle more complex implicit\nhypothetical instructions that require deeper reasoning to infer plausible\nvisual changes and user intent. Additionally, current datasets provide limited\nsupport for training and evaluating reasoning-aware editing capabilities.\nArchitecturally, these methods also lack mechanisms for fine-grained detail\nextraction that support such reasoning. To address these limitations, we\npropose Reason50K, a large-scale dataset specifically curated for training and\nevaluating hypothetical instruction reasoning image editing, along with\nReasonBrain, a novel framework designed to reason over and execute implicit\nhypothetical instructions across diverse scenarios. Reason50K includes over 50K\nsamples spanning four key reasoning scenarios: Physical, Temporal, Causal, and\nStory reasoning. ReasonBrain leverages Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nfor editing guidance generation and a diffusion model for image synthesis,\nincorporating a Fine-grained Reasoning Cue Extraction (FRCE) module to capture\ndetailed visual and textual semantics essential for supporting instruction\nreasoning. To mitigate the semantic loss, we further introduce a Cross-Modal\nEnhancer (CME) that enables rich interactions between the fine-grained cues and\nMLLM-derived features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReasonBrain\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on reasoning scenarios\nwhile exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization to conventional IIE tasks.

In this\nwork, we propose a novel pruning algorithm that strategically prunes attention\nheads in the model's higher layers. Since the removal of attention heads can\nalter the magnitude of token representations, we introduce an adaptive\nrescaling parameter that calibrates the representation scale post-pruning to\ncounteract this effect. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a wide range of\nLLMs, including LLaMA3.1-8B, Mistral-7B-v0.3, Qwen2-7B, and Gemma2-9B.

To address this, we introduce\n\\textbf{Mi}d-\\textbf{Co}T \\textbf{T}eacher \\textbf{A}ssistant Distillation\n(MiCoTAl), a framework for improving long CoT distillation for SLMs. MiCoTA\nemploys intermediate-sized models as teacher assistants and utilizes\nintermediate-length CoT sequences to bridge both the capacity and reasoning\nlength gaps. Our experiments on downstream tasks demonstrate that although SLMs\ndistilled from large teachers can perform poorly, by applying MiCoTA, they\nachieve significant improvements in reasoning performance.

Previous dexterous\nteleoperation mostly relies on hand retargeting to closely mimic human hand\npostures. However, these approaches may fail to fully leverage the inherent\ndexterity of dexterous hands, which can execute unique actions through their\nstructural advantages compared to human hands. To address this limitation, we\npropose TypeTele, a type-guided dexterous teleoperation system, which enables\ndexterous hands to perform actions that are not constrained by human motion\npatterns. This is achieved by introducing dexterous manipulation types into the\nteleoperation system, allowing operators to employ appropriate types to\ncomplete specific tasks. To support this system, we build an extensible\ndexterous manipulation type library to cover comprehensive dexterous postures\nused in manipulation tasks. During teleoperation, we employ a MLLM\n(Multi-modality Large Language Model)-assisted type retrieval module to\nidentify the most suitable manipulation type based on the specific task and\noperator commands. Extensive experiments of real-world teleoperation and\nimitation learning demonstrate that the incorporation of manipulation types\nsignificantly takes full advantage of the dexterous robot's ability to perform\ndiverse and complex tasks with higher success rates.",

    "title": "APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative\n  Tree Search",
    "summary": "Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human\nintervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and\nmaintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a\nrapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable\nperformance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt\ntrial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1)\ninherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low\nsearch efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose\nAPRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS\nincorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing\na global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising\none for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the\nproblems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of\npatch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that,\nwhen integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which\noutperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini,\nGPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs,\nrespectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance\nadvantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the\n500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared\nto existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and\nmonetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study\ndemonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with\nparticular advantages in addressing complex bugs.",

    "summary": "3D Visual Question-Answering (3D VQA) is pivotal for models to perceive the\nphysical world and perform spatial reasoning. Answer-centric supervision is a\ncommonly used training method for 3D VQA models. Many models that utilize this\nstrategy have achieved promising results in 3D VQA tasks. However, the\nanswer-centric approach only supervises the final output of models and allows\nmodels to develop reasoning pathways freely. The absence of supervision on the\nreasoning pathway enables the potential for developing superficial shortcuts\nthrough common patterns in question-answer pairs. Moreover, although\nslow-thinking methods advance large language models, they suffer from\nunderthinking. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{HCNQA}, a 3D VQA\nmodel leveraging a hierarchical concentration narrowing supervision method. By\nmimicking the human process of gradually focusing from a broad area to specific\nobjects while searching for answers, our method guides the model to perform\nthree phases of concentration narrowing through hierarchical supervision. By\nsupervising key checkpoints on a general reasoning pathway, our method can\nensure the development of a rational and effective reasoning pathway.

Current methods typically address this by\nexplicitly injecting visual information to guide the reasoning process. In this\nwork, through an analysis of MLLM attention patterns, we made an intriguing\nobservation: with appropriate guidance, MLLMs can spontaneously re-focus their\nattention on visual inputs during the later stages of reasoning, even without\nexplicit visual information injection. This spontaneous shift in focus suggests\nthat MLLMs are intrinsically capable of performing visual fusion reasoning.\nBuilding on this insight, we introduce Look-Back, an implicit approach designed\nto guide MLLMs to ``look back\" at visual information in a self-directed manner\nduring reasoning. Look-Back empowers the model to autonomously determine when,\nwhere, and how to re-focus on visual inputs, eliminating the need for explicit\nmodel-structure constraints or additional input.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have spurred interests in\nencoding images as discrete tokens and leveraging autoregressive (AR)\nframeworks for visual generation. However, the quantization process in AR-based\nvisual generation models inherently introduces information loss that degrades\nimage fidelity. To mitigate this limitation, recent studies have explored to\nautoregressively predict continuous tokens. Unlike discrete tokens that reside\nin a structured and bounded space, continuous representations exist in an\nunbounded, high-dimensional space, making density estimation more challenging\nand increasing the risk of generating out-of-distribution artifacts. Based on\nthe above findings, this work introduces DisCon (Discrete-Conditioned\nContinuous Autoregressive Model), a novel framework that reinterprets discrete\ntokens as conditional signals rather than generation targets. By modeling the\nconditional probability of continuous representations conditioned on discrete\ntokens, DisCon circumvents the optimization challenges of continuous token\nmodeling while avoiding the information loss caused by quantization. DisCon\nachieves a gFID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256 generation,\noutperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive approaches by a clear margin.\nProject page: https://pengzheng0707.github.io/DisCon.",

However, its reliance on\nlarge volumes of labeled data raises privacy and security concerns such as\nsusceptibility to data poisoning attacks and the risk of overfitting. In\ncontrast, black box optimization methods, which treat the model as an opaque\nfunction, relying solely on function evaluations to guide optimization, offer a\npromising alternative in scenarios where data access is restricted, adversarial\nrisks are high, or overfitting is a concern. However, black box methods also\npose significant challenges, including poor scalability to high-dimensional\nparameter spaces, as prevalent in large language models (LLMs), and high\ncomputational costs due to reliance on numerous model evaluations. This paper\nintroduces BBoxER, an evolutionary black-box method for LLM post-training that\ninduces an information bottleneck via implicit compression of the training\ndata. Leveraging the tractability of information flow, we provide strong\ntheoretical bounds on generalization, differential privacy, susceptibility to\ndata poisoning attacks, and robustness to extraction attacks. BBoxER operates\non top of pre-trained LLMs, offering a lightweight and modular enhancement\nsuitable for deployment in restricted or privacy-sensitive environments, in\naddition to non-vacuous generalization guarantees. In experiments with LLMs, we\ndemonstrate empirically that Retrofitting methods are able to learn, showing\nhow a few iterations of BBoxER improve performance and generalize well on a\nbenchmark of reasoning datasets.

    "summary": "Existing post-training techniques for large language models are broadly\ncategorized into Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning\n(RFT). Each paradigm presents a distinct trade-off: SFT excels at mimicking\ndemonstration data but can lead to problematic generalization as a form of\nbehavior cloning. Conversely, RFT can significantly enhance a model's\nperformance but is prone to learn unexpected behaviors, and its performance is\nhighly sensitive to the initial policy. In this paper, we propose a unified\nview of these methods and introduce Prefix-RFT, a hybrid approach that\nsynergizes learning from both demonstration and exploration. Using mathematical\nreasoning problems as a testbed, we empirically demonstrate that Prefix-RFT is\nboth simple and effective. It not only surpasses the performance of standalone\nSFT and RFT but also outperforms parallel mixed-policy RFT methods. A key\nadvantage is its seamless integration into existing open-source frameworks,\nrequiring only minimal modifications to the standard RFT pipeline. Our analysis\nhighlights the complementary nature of SFT and RFT, and validates that\nPrefix-RFT effectively harmonizes these two learning paradigms. Furthermore,\nablation studies confirm the method's robustness to variations in the quality\nand quantity of demonstration data. We hope this work offers a new perspective\non LLM post-training, suggesting that a unified paradigm that judiciously\nintegrates demonstration and exploration could be a promising direction for\nfuture research.",

This work\nintroduces a simple yet effective approach for robust LLM fingerprinting based\non intrinsic model characteristics. We discover that the standard deviation\ndistributions of attention parameter matrices across different layers exhibit\ndistinctive patterns that remain stable even after extensive continued\ntraining. These parameter distribution signatures serve as robust fingerprints\nthat can reliably identify model lineage and detect potential copyright\ninfringement. Our experimental validation across multiple model families\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our method for model authentication.

    "summary": "Deep learning (DL) systems have been widely adopted in many areas, and are\nbecoming even more popular with the emergence of large language models.\nHowever, due to the complex software stacks involved in their development and\nexecution, crashes are unavoidable and common. Crashes severely waste computing\nresources and hinder development productivity, so efficient crash recovery is\ncrucial. Existing solutions, such as checkpoint-retry, are too heavyweight for\nfast recovery from crashes caused by minor programming errors or transient\nruntime errors. Therefore, we present DaiFu, an in-situ recovery framework for\nDL systems. Through a lightweight code transformation to a given DL system,\nDaiFu augments it to intercept crashes in situ and enables dynamic and instant\nupdates to its program running context (e.g., code, configurations, and other\ndata) for agile crash recovery. Our evaluation shows that DaiFu helps reduce\nthe restore time for crash recovery, achieving a 1372x speedup compared with\nstate-of-the-art solutions. Meanwhile, the overhead of DaiFu is negligible\n(under 0.40%).

    "title": "Emotionally Intelligent Task-oriented Dialogue Systems: Architecture,\n  Representation, and Optimisation",
    "summary": "Task-oriented dialogue (ToD) systems are designed to help users achieve\nspecific goals through natural language interaction. While recent advances in\nlarge language models (LLMs) have significantly improved linguistic fluency and\ncontextual understanding, building effective and emotionally intelligent ToD\nsystems remains a complex challenge. Effective ToD systems must optimise for\ntask success, emotional understanding and responsiveness, and precise\ninformation conveyance, all within inherently noisy and ambiguous\nconversational environments. In this work, we investigate architectural,\nrepresentational, optimisational as well as emotional considerations of ToD\nsystems. We set up systems covering these design considerations with a\nchallenging evaluation environment composed of a natural-language user\nsimulator coupled with an imperfect natural language understanding module. We\npropose \\textbf{LUSTER}, an \\textbf{L}LM-based \\textbf{U}nified \\textbf{S}ystem\nfor \\textbf{T}ask-oriented dialogue with \\textbf{E}nd-to-end\n\\textbf{R}einforcement learning with both short-term (user sentiment) and\nlong-term (task success) rewards. Our findings demonstrate that combining LLM\ncapability with structured reward modelling leads to more resilient and\nemotionally responsive ToD systems, offering a practical path forward for\nnext-generation conversational agents.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention due to their\nversatility across a wide array of applications. Fine-tuning LLMs with\nparameter-efficient adapters, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), enables these\nmodels to efficiently adapt to downstream tasks without extensive retraining.\nDeploying fine-tuned LLMs on multi-tenant edge devices offers substantial\nbenefits, such as reduced latency, enhanced privacy, and personalized\nresponses. However, serving LLMs efficiently on resource-constrained edge\ndevices presents critical challenges, including the complexity of adapter\nselection for different tasks and memory overhead from frequent adapter\nswapping. Moreover, given the multiple requests in multi-tenant settings,\nprocessing requests sequentially results in underutilization of computational\nresources and increased latency. This paper introduces EdgeLoRA, an efficient\nsystem for serving LLMs on edge devices in multi-tenant environments. EdgeLoRA\nincorporates three key innovations: (1) an adaptive adapter selection mechanism\nto streamline the adapter configuration process; (2) heterogeneous memory\nmanagement, leveraging intelligent adapter caching and pooling to mitigate\nmemory operation overhead; and (3) batch LoRA inference, enabling efficient\nbatch processing to significantly reduce computational latency. Comprehensive\nevaluations using the Llama3.1-8B model demonstrate that EdgeLoRA significantly\noutperforms the status quo (i.e., llama.cpp) in terms of both latency and\nthroughput. The results demonstrate that EdgeLoRA can achieve up to a 4 times\nboost in throughput. Even more impressively, it can serve several orders of\nmagnitude more adapters simultaneously. These results highlight EdgeLoRA's\npotential to transform edge deployment of LLMs in multi-tenant scenarios,\noffering a scalable and efficient solution for resource-constrained\nenvironments.",

In our evaluation, we\ncompare two approaches: (1) directly instructing the LLM model to fully\ngenerate and adapt code by treating code as text inputs and (2) a more\nconstrained program synthesis pipeline where the LLM guides the code\nconstruction process by providing structural information (e.g., visual\nencodings) based on properties of the example code and data.

However, automated data quality control faces\nunique challenges in collaborative settings where sharing is not allowed\ndirectly between data silos. To tackle this issue, this paper proposes a novel\ndata quality control technique based on the notion of data influence on the\ntraining dynamics of LLMs, that high quality data are more likely to have\nsimilar training dynamics to the anchor dataset. We then leverage the influence\nof the training dynamics to select high-quality data from different private\ndomains, with centralized model updates on the server side in a collaborative\ntraining fashion by either model merging or federated learning. As for the data\nquality indicator, we compute the per-sample gradients with respect to the\nprivate data and the anchor dataset, and use the trace of the accumulated inner\nproducts as a measurement of data quality. In addition, we develop a quality\ncontrol evaluation tailored for collaborative settings with heterogeneous\ndomain data.

Although traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement\nLearning (MARL) approaches offer dynamic adaptability, they are hindered by the\nsemantic gap in numerical communication and the rigidity of homogeneous role\nstructures, resulting in poor generalization and limited task scalability.\nRecent advances in Large Language Model (LLM)-based control frameworks\ndemonstrate strong semantic reasoning capabilities by leveraging extensive\nprior knowledge.

Furthermore, we propose a Role-value Mixing\nNetwork (RMIX)-based assignment strategy that integrates LLM offline priors\nwith MARL online policies to enable semi-offline training of role selection\nstrategies.

    "summary": "Detecting abnormal events in real-world customer service dialogues is highly\nchallenging due to the complexity of business data and the dynamic nature of\ncustomer interactions. Moreover, models must demonstrate strong out-of-domain\n(OOD) generalization to enable rapid adaptation across different business\nscenarios and maximize commercial value. In this work, we propose a novel\nAdaptive Perplexity-Aware Reinforcement Learning (APARL) framework that\nleverages the advanced reasoning capabilities of large language models for\nabnormal event detection. APARL introduces a dual-loop dynamic curriculum\nlearning architecture, enabling the model to progressively focus on more\nchallenging samples as its proficiency increases. This design effectively\naddresses performance bottlenecks and significantly enhances OOD\ntransferability. Extensive evaluations on food delivery dialogue tasks show\nthat our model achieves significantly enhanced adaptability and robustness,\nattaining the highest F1 score with an average improvement of 17.19\\%, and an\naverage improvement of 9.59\\% in OOD transfer tests.

In this paper, we propose, for the first time, the\ndual-learning hypothesis, which posits that LLMs simultaneously learn both the\ntask-relevant latent concepts and backdoor latent concepts within poisoned\ndemonstrations, jointly influencing the probability of model outputs. Through\ntheoretical analysis, we derive an upper bound for ICL backdoor effects,\nrevealing that the vulnerability is dominated by the concept preference ratio\nbetween the task and the backdoor. Motivated by these findings, we propose\nICLShield, a defense mechanism that dynamically adjusts the concept preference\nratio. Our method encourages LLMs to select clean demonstrations during the ICL\nphase by leveraging confidence and similarity scores, effectively mitigating\nsusceptibility to backdoor attacks.

This paper introduces LaRoSA (Layerwise Rotated Sparse\nActivation), a novel method for activation sparsification designed to improve\nLLM efficiency without requiring additional training or magnitude-based\npruning. We leverage layerwise orthogonal rotations to transform input\nactivations into rotated forms that are more suitable for sparsification.

LaRoSA\nis effective across various sizes and types of LLMs, demonstrating minimal\nperformance degradation and robust inference acceleration. Specifically, for\nLLaMA2-7B at 40% sparsity, LaRoSA achieves a mere 0.17 perplexity gap with a\nconsistent 1.30x wall-clock time speed-up, and reduces the accuracy gap in\nzero-shot tasks compared to the dense model to just 0.54%, while surpassing\nTEAL by 1.77% and CATS by 17.14%.",

This scoping review aims to highlight the areas\nwhere AI is limited to make practical contributions in the clinical setting,\nspecifically in dementia diagnosis and care.\n  Standalone machine-learning models excel at pattern recognition but seldom\nprovide actionable, interpretable guidance, eroding clinician trust. Adjacent\nuse of LLMs by physicians did not result in better diagnostic accuracy or\nspeed.

Hybrid approaches that combine statistical learning with expert\nrule-based knowledge, and involve clinicians throughout the process help bring\nback interpretability. They also fit better with existing clinical workflows,\nas seen in examples like PEIRS and ATHENA-CDS.\n  Future decision-support should prioritise explanatory coherence by linking\npredictions to clinically meaningful causes. This can be done through\nneuro-symbolic or hybrid AI that combines the language ability of LLMs with\nhuman causal expertise. AI researchers have addressed this direction, with\nexplainable AI and neuro-symbolic AI being the next logical steps in further\nadvancement in AI. However, they are still based on data-driven knowledge\nintegration instead of human-in-the-loop approaches.

However, their effectiveness is increasingly\nbeing questioned, particularly in large-scale applications where empirical\nevidence suggests potential performance limitations. In response, this paper\nproposes a stochastic conjugate subgradient method together with adaptive\nsampling tailored specifically for training LLMs. The method not only achieves\nfaster convergence per iteration but also demonstrates improved scalability\ncompared to traditional SGD techniques. It leverages sample complexity analysis\nto adaptively choose the sample size, employs a stochastic conjugate\nsubgradient approach to determine search directions and utilizing an AdamW-like\nalgorithm to adaptively adjust step sizes. This approach preserves the key\nadvantages of first-order methods while effectively addressing the nonconvexity\nand non-smoothness inherent in LLMs training. Additionally, we provide a\ndetailed analysis of the advantage of the algorithm. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed method not only maintains, but in many cases surpasses, the\nscalability of traditional SGD techniques, significantly enhancing both the\nspeed and accuracy of the optimization process.",

    "summary": "There is a huge gap between numerous intriguing applications fostered by\non-device large language model (LLM) fine-tuning (FT) from fresh mobile data\nand the limited resources of a mobile device. While existing server-assisted\nmethods (e.g., split learning or side-tuning) may enable LLM FT on the local\nmobile device, they suffer from heavy communication burdens of activation\ntransmissions, and may disclose data, labels or fine-tuned models to the\nserver. To address those issues, we develop PAE MobiLLM, a privacy-aware and\nefficient LLM FT method which can be deployed on the mobile device via\nserver-assisted additive side-tuning. To further accelerate FT convergence and\nimprove computing efficiency, PAE MobiLLM integrates activation caching on the\nserver side, which allows the server to reuse historical activations and saves\nthe mobile device from repeatedly computing forward passes for the recurring\ndata samples. Besides, to reduce communication cost, PAE MobiLLM develops a\none-token (i.e., ``pivot'' token) activation shortcut that transmits only a\nsingle activation dimension instead of full activation matrices to guide the\nside network tuning. Last but not least, PAE MobiLLM introduces the additive\nadapter side-network design which makes the server train the adapter modules\nbased on device-defined prediction differences rather than raw ground-truth\nlabels. In this way, the server can only assist device-defined side-network\ncomputing, and learn nothing about data, labels or fine-tuned models.",

In this paper, we bridge this\ngap by combining LLM-driven agents with strategic reasoning and real-time\nadaptation in cooperative, multi-agent environments grounded in game-theoretic\nprinciples such as belief consistency and Nash equilibrium. The proposed\nframework applies broadly to dynamic scenarios in which agents coordinate,\ncommunicate, and make decisions in response to continuously changing\nconditions. We provide real-time strategy refinement and adaptive feedback\nmechanisms that enable agents to dynamically adjust policies based on immediate\ncontextual interactions, in contrast to previous efforts that evaluate LLM\ncapabilities in static or turn-based settings. Empirical results show that our\nmethod achieves up to a 26\\% improvement in return over PPO baselines in\nhigh-noise environments, while maintaining real-time latency under 1.05\nmilliseconds. Our approach improves collaboration efficiency, task completion\nrates, and flexibility, illustrating that game-theoretic guidance integrated\nwith real-time feedback enhances LLM performance, ultimately fostering more\nresilient and flexible strategic multi-agent systems.",

    "summary": "Linear attention mechanisms deliver significant advantages for Large Language\nModels (LLMs) by providing linear computational complexity, enabling efficient\nprocessing of ultra-long sequences (e.g., 1M context). However, existing\nSequence Parallelism (SP) methods, essential for distributing these workloads\nacross devices, become the primary bottleneck due to substantial communication\noverhead. In this paper, we introduce ZeCO (Zero Communication Overhead)\nsequence parallelism for linear attention models, a new SP method designed to\novercome these limitations and achieve end-to-end near-linear scalability for\nlong sequence training. For example, training a model with a 1M sequence length\nacross 64 devices using ZeCO takes roughly the same time as training with an\n16k sequence on a single device. At the heart of ZeCO lies All-Scan, a new\ncollective communication primitive. All-Scan provides each SP rank with\nprecisely the initial operator state it requires while maintaining a minimal\ncommunication footprint, effectively eliminating communication overhead.\nTheoretically, we prove the optimaity of ZeCO, showing that it introduces only\nnegligible time and space overhead. Empirically, we compare the communication\ncosts of different sequence parallelism strategies and demonstrate that\nAll-Scan achieves the fastest communication in SP scenarios. Specifically, on\n256 GPUs with an 8M sequence length, ZeCO achieves a 60\\% speedup compared to\nthe current state-of-the-art (SOTA) SP method. We believe ZeCO establishes a\nclear path toward efficiently training next-generation LLMs on previously\nintractable sequence lengths.",

    "title": "Discourse Heuristics For Paradoxically Moral Self-Correction",
    "summary": "Moral self-correction has emerged as a promising approach for aligning the\noutput of Large Language Models (LLMs) with human moral values. However, moral\nself-correction techniques are subject to two primary paradoxes. First, despite\nempirical and theoretical evidence to support the effectiveness of\nself-correction, this LLM capability only operates at a superficial level.\nSecond, while LLMs possess the capability of self-diagnosing immoral aspects of\ntheir output, they struggle to identify the cause of this moral inconsistency\nduring their self-correction process. To better understand and address these\nparadoxes, we analyze the discourse constructions in fine-tuning corpora\ndesigned to enhance moral self-correction, uncovering the existence of the\nheuristics underlying effective constructions. We demonstrate that moral\nself-correction relies on discourse constructions that reflect heuristic\nshortcuts, and that the presence of these heuristic shortcuts during\nself-correction leads to inconsistency when attempting to enhance both\nself-correction and self-diagnosis capabilities jointly. Based on our findings,\nwe propose a solution to improve moral self-correction by leveraging the\nheuristics of curated datasets. We also highlight the generalization challenges\nof this capability, particularly in terms of learning from situated context and\nmodel scales.",

    "summary": "As autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) continue to\ndemonstrate potential across various assistive tasks, ensuring their safe and\nreliable behavior is crucial for preventing unintended consequences. In this\nwork, we introduce CIP, a novel technique that leverages causal influence\ndiagrams (CIDs) to identify and mitigate risks arising from agent\ndecision-making. CIDs provide a structured representation of cause-and-effect\nrelationships, enabling agents to anticipate harmful outcomes and make safer\ndecisions. Our approach consists of three key steps: (1) initializing a CID\nbased on task specifications to outline the decision-making process, (2)\nguiding agent interactions with the environment using the CID, and (3)\niteratively refining the CID based on observed behaviors and outcomes.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our method effectively enhances safety in\nboth code execution and mobile device control tasks.",

    "summary": "Triage errors, including undertriage and overtriage, are persistent\nchallenges in emergency departments (EDs). With increasing patient influx and\nstaff shortages, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into triage\nprotocols has gained attention. This study compares the performance of three AI\nmodels [Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLM), and\nJoint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA)] in predicting triage outcomes\nagainst the FRENCH scale and clinical practice.We conducted a retrospective\nanalysis of a prospectively recruited cohort gathering adult patient triage\ndata over a 7-month period at the Roger Salengro Hospital ED (Lille, France).\nThree AI models were trained and validated : (1) TRIAGEMASTER (NLP), (2)\nURGENTIAPARSE (LLM), and (3) EMERGINET (JEPA). Data included demographic\ndetails, verbatim chief complaints, vital signs, and triage outcomes based on\nthe FRENCH scale and GEMSA coding. The primary outcome was the concordance of\nAI-predicted triage level with the FRENCH gold-standard. It was assessed thanks\nto various indicators : F1-Score, Weighted Kappa, Spearman, MAE, RMSE. The LLM\nmodel (URGENTIAPARSE) showed higher accuracy (composite score: 2.514) compared\nto JEPA (EMERGINET, 0.438) and NLP (TRIAGEMASTER, -3.511), outperforming nurse\ntriage (-4.343). Secondary analyses highlighted the effectiveness of\nURGENTIAPARSE in predicting hospitalization needs (GEMSA) and its robustness\nwith structured data versus raw transcripts (either for GEMSA prediction or for\nFRENCH prediction). LLM architecture, through abstraction of patient\nrepresentations, offers the most accurate triage predictions among tested\nmodels. Integrating AI into ED workflows could enhance patient safety and\noperational efficiency, though integration into clinical workflows requires\naddressing model limitations and ensuring ethical transparency.",

    "summary": "With the wide application of multimodal foundation models in intelligent\nagent systems, scenarios such as mobile device control, intelligent assistant\ninteraction, and multimodal task execution are gradually relying on such large\nmodel-driven agents. However, the related systems are also increasingly exposed\nto potential jailbreak risks. Attackers may induce the agents to bypass the\noriginal behavioral constraints through specific inputs, and then trigger\ncertain risky and sensitive operations, such as modifying settings, executing\nunauthorized commands, or impersonating user identities, which brings new\nchallenges to system security. Existing security measures for intelligent\nagents still have limitations when facing complex interactions, especially in\ndetecting potentially risky behaviors across multiple rounds of conversations\nor sequences of tasks. In addition, an efficient and consistent automated\nmethodology to assist in assessing and determining the impact of such risks is\ncurrently lacking. This work explores the security issues surrounding mobile\nmultimodal agents, attempts to construct a risk discrimination mechanism by\nincorporating behavioral sequence information, and designs an automated\nassisted assessment scheme based on a large language model. Through preliminary\nvalidation in several representative high-risk tasks, the results show that the\nmethod can improve the recognition of risky behaviors to some extent and assist\nin reducing the probability of agents being jailbroken. We hope that this study\ncan provide some valuable references for the security risk modeling and\nprotection of multimodal intelligent agent systems.",

Stylometry has been\nused extensively to characterise the style and attribute authorship of texts.\nBy applying it to LLM-generated texts, we identify their emergent writing\npatterns. The paper involves creating a benchmark dataset based on Wikipedia,\nwith (a) human-written term summaries, (b) texts generated purely by LLMs\n(GPT-3.5/4, LLaMa 2/3, Orca, and Falcon), (c) processed through multiple text\nsummarisation methods (T5, BART, Gensim, and Sumy), and (d) rephrasing methods\n(Dipper, T5). The 10-sentence long texts were classified by tree-based models\n(decision trees and LightGBM) using human-designed (StyloMetrix) and\nn-gram-based (our own pipeline) stylometric features that encode lexical,\ngrammatical, syntactic, and punctuation patterns.

Crucially,\nthe analysis also extends to the observed adoption of LLMs by malicious actors,\nunderscoring the inherent dual-use challenge of this technology within the\nsecurity landscape.\n  The unexpected effectiveness of LLMs in this context is elucidated by several\nkey factors: the strong alignment between penetration testing's reliance on\npattern-matching and LLMs' core strengths, their inherent capacity to manage\nuncertainty in dynamic environments, and cost-effective access to competent\npre-trained models through LLM providers.\n  The current landscape of LLM-aided penetration testing is categorized into\ninteractive 'vibe-hacking' and the emergence of fully autonomous systems.

We propose a novel decoder-only Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to detect anomalies in Electronic Control Unit (ECU)\ncommunication logs. Our approach addresses two key challenges: the lack of LLMs\ntailored for ECU communication and the complexity of inconsistent ground truth\ndata. By learning from UDP communication logs, we formulate anomaly detection\nsimply as identifying deviations in time from normal behavior. We introduce an\nentropy regularization technique that increases model's uncertainty in known\nanomalies while maintaining consistency in similar scenarios. Our solution\noffers three novelties: a decoder-only anomaly detection architecture, a way to\nhandle inconsistent labeling, and an adaptable LLM for different ECU\ncommunication use cases. By leveraging the generative capabilities of\ndecoder-only models, we present a new technique that addresses the high cost\nand error-prone nature of manual labeling through a more scalable system that\nis able to learn from a minimal set of examples, while improving detection\naccuracy in complex communication environments.",

    "summary": "Moral judgment is integral to large language model (LLM) alignment and social\nreasoning. As multi-agent systems gain prominence, it becomes crucial to\nunderstand how LLMs function collectively during collaboration, compared to\nindividual agents. In human moral judgment, group deliberation leads to a\nutilitarian boost: a tendency to endorse norm violations that maximize benefits\nfor the greatest number of people despite harms. We study whether a similar\ndynamic emerges in multi-agent LLM systems. We tested six models on\nwell-established sets of moral dilemmas across two conditions: (1) Solo, where\nmodels reasoned independently, and (2) Group, where they engaged in multi-turn\ndiscussions in pairs or triads. In personal moral dilemmas, where agents must\ndecide to directly harm one individual to maximize the utility for others, all\nmodels found moral violations to be more acceptable when part of a group than\nindividually, similar to human experiments. Some models endorsed actions that\nmaximized overall well-being, even if they benefited strangers over familiar\nindividuals. Others became more willing to violate moral norms in groups.\nHowever, while human groups show a similar action bias, the mechanism for their\nutilitarian boost differs from LLMs. Whereas the human shift comes from\nheightened sensitivity to decision outcomes, LLM groups show either reduced\nnorm sensitivity or enhanced impartiality. This suggests that while the surface\nbehavior of LLM collectives mimics human group reasoning, the underlying\ndrivers differ. We discuss the implications for AI alignment, multi-agent\ndesign, and artificial moral reasoning.",

Direct\nfusion often fails to fully exploit the LLM's potential and suffers from\nunstable finetuning. As a result, LLM blocks are kept frozen while only the\nvision components are learned. As a remedy to these challenges, we introduce\nLanguage-Unlocked Vision Transformers (LUViT), a novel approach that bridges\nthis modality mismatch through a synergistic pre-training strategy. LUViT\nco-adapts a ViT backbone and an LLM fusion block by (1) employing Masked\nAuto-Encoding (MAE) to pre-train the ViT for richer visual representations, and\n(2) concurrently training Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) layers within the LLM\nblock using the MAE objective. This joint optimization guides the ViT to\nproduce LLM-aligned features and the LLM to effectively interpret visual\ninformation.

    "summary": "Large Language Model-based generative recommendation (LLMRec) has achieved\nnotable success, but it suffers from high inference latency due to massive\ncomputational overhead and memory pressure of KV Cache. Existing KV Cache\nreduction methods face critical limitations: cache compression offers marginal\nacceleration given recommendation tasks' short decoding steps, while prompt\ncompression risks discarding vital interaction history. Through systematic\nanalysis of attention patterns in LLMRec, we uncover two pivotal insights: 1)\nlayer-wise attention sparsity inversion where early layers retain dense\ninformative patterns while later layers exhibit high redundancy, and 2) dual\nattention sinks phenomenon where attention scores concentrate on both head and\ntail tokens of input sequences.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have advanced significantly in code generation,\nyet their ability to follow complex programming instructions with layered and\ndiverse constraints remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks often prioritize\nfunctional correctness, overlooking the nuanced requirements found in\nreal-world development. We introduce MultiCodeIF, a comprehensive benchmark\ndesigned to evaluate instruction-following in code generation across multiple\ndimensions: constraint type, hierarchical levels, and iterative refinement.\nBuilt upon a structured taxonomy of 9 categories and 27 constraint types,\nMultiCodeIF enables granular assessment of both functional and non-functional\ninstruction adherence. Using an automated pipeline, ConstraGen, we synthesize\nand evolve 2,021 code tasks sourced from 14 programming languages, supporting\nmulti-turn evaluation through feedback-driven task variants. Empirical\nevaluation of six state-of-the-art LLMs uncovers substantial performance\ndisparities. The top-performing model, Claude-3-7-Sonnet, achieves 63.0%\naverage constraint satisfaction, while smaller models like Qwen3-1.7B fall to\n44.8%. Models perform well on explicit constraints, but struggle with implicit\nor abstract constraints. Tasks with multiple hierarchical constraints\nsignificantly reduce model success rates, from 54.5% in single-level to just\n18.8% in multi-level scenarios. However, structured feedback enables\nprogressive improvement: average constraint satisfaction rises from 63.0% to\n83.4% over four iterative refinement rounds. MultiCodeIF provides a scalable,\nconstraint-aware, and feedback-sensitive framework to benchmark LLMs under\nrealistic code generation scenarios, bridging the gap between synthetic\nevaluations and real-world instruction complexity.

This paper\naims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel paradigm: the Cognitive\nLoad-Aware Inference (CLAI) framework, which operationalizes principles from\nCognitive Load Theory (CLT) and neuroscience for LLM inference. We formalize\nthe concepts of Intrinsic Cognitive Load, Extraneous Cognitive Load, and\nGermane Cognitive Load into quantifiable LLM metrics ($ICL_{LLM}$, $ECL_{LLM}$,\nand $GCL_{LLM}$), thereby reframing the inference process as a cognitive\neconomics optimization problem: based on the intrinsic complexity of a problem\n($ICL_{LLM}$), minimize wasteful computation ($ECL_{LLM}$), and strategically\nallocate the token budget to productive reasoning ($GCL_{LLM}$). We propose two\nimplementation paths: CLAI-Prompt, a zero-shot method that guides a base LLM\nthrough cognitive control steps via a structured meta-prompt, and CLAI-Tune, a\nfine-tuned model that internalizes these principles for spontaneous cognitive\neconomy. Across a range of benchmarks in complex reasoning, long-context\nquestion answering, and code generation, our methods achieve significant\nreductions in token consumption (up to 45\\%) without sacrificing accuracy.\nFurthermore, CLAI-Tune exhibits an emergent ability to autonomously decompose\ndifficult problems, a key characteristic of human expert cognition.

    "summary": "This paper addresses the limited transfer and adaptation capabilities of\nlarge language models in low-resource language scenarios. It proposes a unified\nframework that combines a knowledge transfer module with parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning strategies. The method introduces knowledge alignment loss and soft\nprompt tuning to guide the model in effectively absorbing the structural\nfeatures of target languages or tasks under minimal annotation. This enhances\nboth generalization performance and training stability. The framework includes\nlightweight adaptation modules to reduce computational costs. During training,\nit integrates freezing strategies and prompt injection to preserve the model's\noriginal knowledge while enabling quick adaptation to new tasks. The study also\nconducts stability analysis experiments and synthetic pseudo-data transfer\nexperiments to systematically evaluate the method's applicability and\nrobustness across different low-resource tasks. Experimental results show that\ncompared with existing multilingual pre-trained models and mainstream transfer\nmethods, the proposed approach achieves higher performance and stability on\ncross-lingual tasks such as MLQA, XQuAD, and PAWS-X. It demonstrates\nparticularly strong advantages under extremely data-scarce conditions. The\nproposed method offers strong generality and scalability. It enhances\ntask-specific adaptability while preserving the general capabilities of large\nlanguage models. This makes it well-suited for complex semantic modeling and\nmultilingual processing tasks.",

In this\nwork, we propose a modular pipeline for advertisement management in RAG-based\nconversational systems, consisting of an ad-rewriter for seamless ad\nintegration and a robust ad-classifier for detection. We leverage synthetic\ndata to train high-performing classifiers, which are then used to guide two\ncomplementary ad-integration strategies: supervised fine-tuning of the\nad-rewriter and a best-of-N sampling approach that selects the least detectable\nad-integrated response among multiple candidates. Our evaluation focuses on two\ncore questions: the effectiveness of ad classifiers in detecting diverse ad\nintegration strategies, and the training methods that best support coherent,\nminimally intrusive ad insertion. Experimental results show that our\nad-classifier, trained on synthetic advertisement data inspired by marketing\nstrategies and enhanced through curriculum learning, achieves robust detection\nperformance. Additionally, we demonstrate that classifier-guided optimization,\nthrough both fine-tuning and best-of-N sampling, significantly improves ad\nstealth, enabling more seamless integration. These findings contribute an\nadversarial co-evolution framework for developing more sophisticated ad-aware\ngenerative search systems and robust ad classifiers.",

Our\napproach offers three key advantages: 1) We propose a novel Projector, which\nuses convolutional kernels to derive visual spatial tokens from ViT patch\nfeatures, simulating two visual spatial ordering approaches: \"from central\nregion to global\" and \"from abstract to specific\". Then, a cross-attention\nmechanism is applied to fuse fine-grained visual information, enriching the\noverall visual representation. 2) We present two model variants:\nLLaVA-SP-Cropping, which focuses on detail features through progressive\ncropping, and LLaVA-SP-Pooling, which captures global semantics through\nadaptive pooling, enabling the model to handle diverse visual understanding\ntasks. 3) Extensive experiments show that LLaVA-SP, fine-tuned with LoRA,\nachieves significant performance improvements across various multimodal\nbenchmarks, outperforming the state-of-the-art LLaVA-1.5 model in multiple\ntasks with nearly identical inference latency.

    "summary": "Math reasoning has become the poster child of progress in large language\nmodels (LLMs), with new models rapidly surpassing human-level performance on\nbenchmarks like MATH and AIME. But as math leaderboards improve week by week,\nit is worth asking: do these gains reflect broader problem-solving ability or\njust narrow overfitting? To answer this question, we evaluate over 20\nopen-weight reasoning-tuned models across a broad suite of tasks, including\nmath, scientific QA, agent planning, coding, and standard\ninstruction-following. We surprisingly find that most models that succeed in\nmath fail to transfer their gains to other domains. To rigorously study this\nphenomenon, we conduct controlled experiments on Qwen3-14B models using\nmath-only data but different tuning methods. We find that reinforcement\nlearning (RL)-tuned models generalize well across domains, while supervised\nfine-tuning (SFT)-tuned models often forget general capabilities. Latent-space\nrepresentation and token-space distribution shift analyses reveal that SFT\ninduces substantial representation and output drift, while RL preserves\ngeneral-domain structure. Our results suggest a need to rethink standard\npost-training recipes, particularly the reliance on SFT-distilled data for\nadvancing reasoning models.",

This\npaper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback\ngeneration derived from established feedback models and local insights from\nsecondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a\nweb-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that\nfollows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight\nsecondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers\nconsider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support\nstudents and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through\ninstant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such\nas its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a\nlimitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human\nexpertise to ensure effective student learning.

To further enhance code\nquality, iPanda incorporates an iterative self-correction mechanism to refine\ngenerated test scripts interactively. Finally, by executing and analyzing the\ngenerated tests, iPanda systematically verifies compliance between\nimplementations and protocol specifications.

    "summary": "Grounding large language models (LLMs) in verifiable external sources is a\nwell-established strategy for generating reliable answers. Retrieval-augmented\ngeneration (RAG) is one such approach, particularly effective for tasks like\nquestion answering: it retrieves passages that are semantically related to the\nquestion and then conditions the model on this evidence. However, multi-hop\nquestions, such as \"Which company among NVIDIA, Apple, and Google made the\nbiggest profit in 2023?,\" challenge RAG because relevant facts are often\ndistributed across multiple documents rather than co-occurring in one source,\nmaking it difficult for standard RAG to retrieve sufficient information. To\naddress this, we propose a RAG pipeline that incorporates question\ndecomposition: (i) an LLM decomposes the original query into sub-questions,\n(ii) passages are retrieved for each sub-question, and (iii) the merged\ncandidate pool is reranked to improve the coverage and precision of the\nretrieved evidence. We show that question decomposition effectively assembles\ncomplementary documents, while reranking reduces noise and promotes the most\nrelevant passages before answer generation. Although reranking itself is\nstandard, we show that pairing an off-the-shelf cross-encoder reranker with\nLLM-driven question decomposition bridges the retrieval gap on multi-hop\nquestions and provides a practical, drop-in enhancement, without any extra\ntraining or specialized indexing. We evaluate our approach on the MultiHop-RAG\nand HotpotQA, showing gains in retrieval (MRR@10: +36.7%) and answer accuracy\n(F1: +11.6%) over standard RAG baselines.",

Most recent\nworks in ASD explore the use of large language models (LLMs) in goal-driven\nsettings, relying on human-specified research questions to guide hypothesis\ngeneration. However, scientific discovery may be accelerated further by\nallowing the AI system to drive exploration by its own criteria. The few\nexisting approaches in open-ended ASD select hypotheses based on diversity\nheuristics or subjective proxies for human interestingness, but the former\nstruggles to meaningfully navigate the typically vast hypothesis space, and the\nlatter suffers from imprecise definitions. This paper presents AutoDS -- a\nmethod for open-ended ASD that instead drives scientific exploration using\nBayesian surprise. Here, we quantify the epistemic shift from the LLM's prior\nbeliefs about a hypothesis to its posterior beliefs after gathering\nexperimental results. To efficiently explore the space of nested hypotheses,\nour method employs a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) strategy with progressive\nwidening using surprisal as the reward function.

Our findings reveal that the\nstandalone LLM introduces nearly 9x more new vulnerabilities than developers,\nwith many of these exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code.\nAgentic workflows also generate a significant number of vulnerabilities,\nparticularly when granting LLMs more autonomy, potentially increasing the\nlikelihood of misinterpreting project context or task requirements. We find\nthat vulnerabilities are more likely to occur in LLM patches associated with a\nhigher number of files, more lines of generated code, and GitHub issues that\nlack specific code snippets or information about the expected code behavior and\nsteps to reproduce. These results suggest that contextual factors play a\ncritical role in the security of the generated code and point toward the need\nfor proactive risk assessment methods that account for both code and\nissue-level information to complement existing vulnerability detection tools.",

However,\nthe privacy risks arising from memorization during fine-tuning have received\nrelatively little attention. To address this gap, we categorize popular\nfine-tuning approaches and assess their impact on memorization through the lens\nof membership inference attacks (MIAs). Our results show that, compared to\nparameter-based fine-tuning, prompt-based fine-tuning achieves competitive\nperformance while exhibiting lower vulnerability to MIAs. Furthermore,\nprompt-based methods maintain low memorization regardless of model scale.

This paper introduces a novel two-stage approach to enhance\ntext classification by leveraging Large Language Model (LLM)-generated\nreasonings. In the first stage, we fine-tune a Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct model\n(henceforth Llama-R-Gen) on a general-purpose reasoning dataset\n(syvai/reasoning-gen) to generate textual reasoning (R) given a question and\nits answer. In the second stage, this generally trained Llama-R-Gen is used\noffline to create an augmented training dataset for a downstream generative\nmodel. This downstream model, based on Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, takes only the\ninput text (Q) and is trained to output the generated reasoning (R) immediately\nfollowed by the predicted emotion (A). We demonstrate this methodology on the\ndair-ai/emotion dataset for emotion classification. Our experiments show that\nthe generative model trained to output reasoning and the emotion (Classifier\nQ->RA) achieves a significant improvement of 8.7 percentage points in accuracy\n(for emotion prediction) compared to a baseline generative model trained solely\nto output the emotion (Classifier Q->A), highlighting the strong generalization\ncapabilities of the reasoning generation and the benefit of explicit reasoning\ntraining.

    "summary": "Data selection plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making, including\nin large language models (LLMs), and is typically task-dependent. Properties\nsuch as data quality and diversity have been extensively studied and are known\nto enhance model performance. However, it remains unclear whether there exist\nother quantitative and general principles of data selection that can\nconsistently improve performance, especially for complex tasks with limited\nprior knowledge. In this paper, we demonstrate that selecting more uniformly\ndistributed data can improve training efficiency while enhancing performance.\nSpecifically, we establish that more uniform (less biased) distribution leads\nto a larger minimum pairwise distance between data points, denoted by\n$h_{\\min}$, and prove that a smaller $h_{\\min}$ can slow down the training\ndynamics of gradient descent (GD). Moreover, we theoretically show that the\napproximation error of neural networks decreases as $h_{\\min}$ increases. Our\nanalysis introduces a convergence framework for GD beyond the Neural Tangent\nKernel (NTK) regime, applicable to a broad class of architectures, including\ntransformers, without requiring Lipschitz smoothness. This framework further\nprovides theoretical justification for the use of residual connections and\nfunction compositions in deep neural architectures. In the end, we conduct\ncomprehensive experiments for supervised fine-tuning across various settings,\nincluding different optimization strategies, model sizes, and training\ndatasets. The results consistently demonstrate that selecting data by\nmaximizing pairwise distance significantly accelerates training and achieves\ncomparable or better performance in LLMs across diverse datasets.

On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and\nlearning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather\nthan on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for\nthe use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its\nexecution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming,\nthus fostering a deeper understanding among students.\n  Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming\ncourse are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the\nincorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the\ntraining process.",

    "summary": "The proliferation of agentic Large Language Models (LLMs) on personal devices\nintroduces a new class of workloads characterized by a dichotomy of objectives.\nReactive tasks, initiated by users, demand immediate, low-latency responses,\nwhile proactive tasks operate invisibly and prioritize throughput. Existing\non-device LLM engines, designed for isolated inferences, fail to efficiently\nmanage these concurrent and conflicting requests on consumer-grade\nheterogeneous SoCs with CPU, integrated GPU, and NPU. This paper introduces\nAgent.xpu, an efficient serving system for agentic LLM workloads on\nmemory-unified heterogeneous SoCs. With dedicated offline profiling, Agent.xpu\nfirst constructs a heterogeneous execution graph, which fuses and chunks model\nkernels for affinity-guided, elastic accelerator mapping with predictive kernel\nannotation. At runtime, its online scheduler enables fine-grained, kernel-level\npreemption to guarantee the responsiveness of reactive tasks. To maximize SoC\nutilization, it adopts slack-aware kernel backfill to opportunistically append\nproactive tasks, and mitigates NPU-iGPU contention via bandwidth-aware\ndispatch. Evaluation on an Intel Core Ultra SoC shows that Agent.xpu achieves\n4.6$\\times$ lower latency for reactive tasks and sustains\n1.6$\\times$-6.8$\\times$ higher throughput for proactive tasks compared to\nstate-of-the-art inference engines.",

    "summary": "The progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT raises the question\nof how they can be integrated into education. One hope is that they can support\nmathematics learning, including word-problem solving. Since LLMs can handle\ntextual input with ease, they appear well-suited for solving mathematical word\nproblems. Yet their real competence, whether they can make sense of the\nreal-world context, and the implications for classrooms remain unclear. We\nconducted a scoping review from a mathematics-education perspective, including\nthree parts: a technical overview, a systematic review of word problems used in\nresearch, and a state-of-the-art empirical evaluation of LLMs on mathematical\nword problems. First, in the technical overview, we contrast the\nconceptualization of word problems and their solution processes between LLMs\nand students. In computer-science research this is typically labeled\nmathematical reasoning, a term that does not align with usage in mathematics\neducation. Second, our literature review of 213 studies shows that the most\npopular word-problem corpora are dominated by s-problems, which do not require\na consideration of realities of their real-world context. Finally, our\nevaluation of GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4.1, and o3 on 287 word problems\nshows that most recent LLMs solve these s-problems with near-perfect accuracy,\nincluding a perfect score on 20 problems from PISA. LLMs still showed\nweaknesses in tackling problems where the real-world context is problematic or\nnon-sensical. In sum, we argue based on all three aspects that LLMs have\nmastered a superficial solution process but do not make sense of word problems,\nwhich potentially limits their value as instructional tools in mathematics\nclassrooms.",

Recent progress in hate speech detection is\ntypically concentrated on high-resource languages. However, low-resource\nlanguages still face significant challenges due to the lack of large-scale,\nhigh-quality datasets. This paper investigates how we can overcome this\nlimitation via prompt engineering on large language models (LLMs) focusing on\nlow-resource Bengali language. We investigate six prompting strategies -\nzero-shot prompting, refusal suppression, flattering the classifier, multi-shot\nprompting, role prompting, and finally our innovative metaphor prompting to\ndetect hate speech effectively in low-resource languages. We pioneer the\nmetaphor prompting to circumvent the built-in safety mechanisms of LLMs that\nmarks a significant departure from existing jailbreaking methods. We\ninvestigate all six different prompting strategies on the Llama2-7B model and\ncompare the results extensively with three pre-trained word embeddings - GloVe,\nWord2Vec, and FastText for three different deep learning models - multilayer\nperceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and bidirectional gated\nrecurrent unit (BiGRU). To prove the effectiveness of our metaphor prompting in\nthe low-resource Bengali language, we also evaluate it in another low-resource\nlanguage - Hindi, and two high-resource languages - English and German. The\nperformance of all prompting techniques is evaluated using the F1 score, and\nenvironmental impact factor (IF), which measures CO$_2$ emissions, electricity\nusage, and computational time.",

We examine two common methods for\nprobing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed.\nTo address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse\nAware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal\nactivations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither.\nsAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We\nevaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including\nboth default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the\ninsights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the\nthird quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always\nsymmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default\nmodels; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for\nsome LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge\ndistillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from\ntrue and false and is neither true nor false.

    "title": "PBa-LLM: Privacy- and Bias-aware NLP using Named-Entity Recognition\n  (NER)",
    "summary": "The use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in highstakes AI-based\napplications has increased significantly in recent years, especially since the\nemergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, despite their strong\nperformance, LLMs introduce important legal/ ethical concerns, particularly\nregarding privacy, data protection, and transparency. Due to these concerns,\nthis work explores the use of Named- Entity Recognition (NER) to facilitate the\nprivacy-preserving training (or adaptation) of LLMs. We propose a framework\nthat uses NER technologies to anonymize sensitive information in text data,\nsuch as personal identities or geographic locations. An evaluation of the\nproposed privacy-preserving learning framework was conducted to measure its\nimpact on user privacy and system performance in a particular high-stakes and\nsensitive setup: AI-based resume scoring for recruitment processes. The study\ninvolved two language models (BERT and RoBERTa) and six anonymization\nalgorithms (based on Presidio, FLAIR, BERT, and different versions of GPT)\napplied to a database of 24,000 candidate profiles. The findings indicate that\nthe proposed privacy preservation techniques effectively maintain system\nperformance while playing a critical role in safeguarding candidate\nconfidentiality, thus promoting trust in the experimented scenario. On top of\nthe proposed privacy-preserving approach, we also experiment applying an\nexisting approach that reduces the gender bias in LLMs, thus finally obtaining\nour proposed Privacyand Bias-aware LLMs (PBa-LLMs). Note that the proposed\nPBa-LLMs have been evaluated in a particular setup (resume scoring), but are\ngenerally applicable to any other LLM-based AI application.",

    "summary": "We introduce context augmentation, a data-augmentation approach that uses\nlarge language models (LLMs) to generate contexts around observed strings as a\nmeans of facilitating valid frequentist inference. These generated contexts\nserve to reintroduce uncertainty, incorporate auxiliary information, and\nfacilitate interpretability. For example, in the two-sample test, we compare\nthe log-probability of strings under contexts from its own versus the other\ngroup. We show on synthetic data that the method's t-statistics exhibit the\nexpected null behaviour while maintaining power and, through a replication,\nthat the method is powerful and interpretable. We next introduce text-on-text\nregression. Contexts generated around the predictor string are treated as\nmediating variables between the predictor and outcome strings. Using negative\ncontrols, we then distinguish between semantic and syntactic dimensions of\nprediction. Analysis of real-world dialogic data illustrates behaviour\npredicted from a psycholinguistic framework. Theoretically, we provide\nidentification conditions, derive an influence-function decomposition, and show\nthat repeated cross-fitting of a pivotal statistic yields higher-order\nefficiency. We derive bounds linking estimation error, context count, and\nnumber of cross-fits. Taken together, context augmentation offers the ability\nto connect LLMs with longstanding statistical practice.",

The\nsystem connects email communication channels with Optical Character Recognition\n(OCR) and intelligent automation, enabling non-technical administrative staff\nto delegate complex form-filling and document processing tasks using familiar\nemail interfaces. By treating the email body as a natural language prompt and\nattachments as contextual information, the workflow bridges the gap between\nadvanced AI capabilities and practical usability. Empirical evaluation shows\nthat the system can complete complex administrative forms in under 8 seconds of\nautomated processing, with human supervision reducing total staff time by a\nfactor of three to four compared to manual workflows. The top-performing LLM\naccurately filled 16 out of 29 form fields and reduced the total cost per\nprocessed form by 64% relative to manual completion. These findings demonstrate\nthat email-based LLM integration is a viable and cost-effective approach for\ndemocratizing advanced automation in organizational settings, supporting\nwidespread adoption without requiring specialized technical knowledge or major\nworkflow changes.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed the rise of\nautonomous AI agents capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting in dynamic,\nopen-ended environments. These large-model agents mark a paradigm shift from\nstatic inference systems to interactive, memory-augmented entities. While these\ncapabilities significantly expand the functional scope of AI, they also\nintroduce qualitatively novel security risks - such as memory poisoning, tool\nmisuse, reward hacking, and emergent misalignment - that extend beyond the\nthreat models of conventional systems or standalone LLMs. In this survey, we\nfirst examine the structural foundations and key capabilities that underpin\nincreasing levels of agent autonomy, including long-term memory retention,\nmodular tool use, recursive planning, and reflective reasoning. We then analyze\nthe corresponding security vulnerabilities across the agent stack, identifying\nfailure modes such as deferred decision hazards, irreversible tool chains, and\ndeceptive behaviors arising from internal state drift or value misalignment.\nThese risks are traced to architectural fragilities that emerge across\nperception, cognition, memory, and action modules. To address these challenges,\nwe systematically review recent defense strategies deployed at different\nautonomy layers, including input sanitization, memory lifecycle control,\nconstrained decision-making, structured tool invocation, and introspective\nreflection. We introduce the Reflective Risk-Aware Agent Architecture (R2A2), a\nunified cognitive framework grounded in Constrained Markov Decision Processes\n(CMDPs), which incorporates risk-aware world modeling, meta-policy adaptation,\nand joint reward-risk optimization to enable principled, proactive safety\nacross the agent's decision-making loop.",

However, the understanding\nof long videos is still challenging, as their long-context nature results in\nsignificant computational and memory overhead. Most existing work treats long\nvideos in the same way as short videos, which is inefficient for real-world\napplications and hard to generalize to even longer videos. To address these\nissues, we propose Flash-VStream, an efficient video language model capable of\nprocessing extremely long videos and responding to user queries in real time.\nParticularly, we design a Flash Memory module, containing a low-capacity\ncontext memory to aggregate long-context temporal information and model the\ndistribution of information density, and a high-capacity augmentation memory to\nretrieve detailed spatial information based on this distribution. Compared to\nexisting models, Flash-VStream achieves significant reductions in inference\nlatency. Extensive experiments on long video benchmarks and comprehensive video\nbenchmarks, i.e., EgoSchema, MLVU, LVBench, MVBench and Video-MME, demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance and outstanding efficiency of our method.

    "summary": "The influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI), and specifically Large\nLanguage Models (LLM), on education is continuously increasing. These models\nare frequently used by students, giving rise to the question whether current\nforms of assessment are still a valid way to evaluate student performance and\ncomprehension. The theoretical framework developed in this paper is grounded in\nConstructive Alignment (CA) theory and Bloom's taxonomy for defining learning\nobjectives. We argue that AI influences learning objectives of different Bloom\nlevels in a different way, and assessment has to be adopted accordingly.\nFurthermore, in line with Bloom's vision, formative and summative assessment\nshould be aligned on whether the use of AI is permitted or not.\n  Although lecturers tend to agree that education and assessment need to be\nadapted to the presence of AI, a strong bias exists on the extent to which\nlecturers want to allow for AI in assessment. This bias is caused by a\nlecturer's familiarity with AI and specifically whether they use it themselves.\nTo avoid this bias, we propose structured guidelines on a university or faculty\nlevel, to foster alignment among the staff. Besides that, we argue that\nteaching staff should be trained on the capabilities and limitations of AI\ntools. In this way, they are better able to adapt their assessment methods.",

In this study, we quantify and analyze positional bias\nacross five large language models under varying degrees of answer uncertainty.\nWe re-adapted the SQuAD-it dataset by adding an extra incorrect answer option\nand then created multiple versions with progressively less context and more\nout-of-context answers, yielding datasets that range from low to high\nuncertainty. Additionally, we evaluate two naturally higher-uncertainty\nbenchmarks: (1) WebGPT - question pairs with unequal human-assigned quality\nscores, and (2) Winning Arguments - where models predict the more persuasive\nargument in Reddit's r/ChangeMyView exchanges. Across each dataset, the order\nof the \"correct\" (or higher-quality/persuasive) option is systematically\nflipped (first placed in position 1, then in position 2) to compute both\nPreference Fairness and Position Consistency.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance on various\ntasks, but existing evaluation benchmarks are often static and insufficient to\nfully assess their robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios. Prior\nwork using evolutionary or adversarial data augmentation has improved\nevaluation diversity but lacks systematic control over perturbation types and\nmulti-step complexity, limiting comprehensive robustness analysis. To address\nthese gaps, we propose AutoEvoEval, an evolution-based evaluation framework for\nclose-ended tasks such as multi-choice question answering.

We conduct extensive experiments\naddressing four research questions on a broad set of open- and closed-source\nLLMs. Our results show that atomic operations cause an average accuracy drop of\n7.283\\%, with structure-disrupting or misleading semantic edits causing the\nlargest declines. Model sensitivities vary significantly for the same\nperturbation, and combining multiple evolution steps amplifies adversarial\neffects by up to 52.932\\%. These findings suggest current benchmarks may\noverestimate true model generalization and emphasize the need for\nevolution-aware robustness evaluation.

    "summary": "Image generative models have become increasingly popular, but training them\nrequires large datasets that are costly to collect and curate. To circumvent\nthese costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated\nimages as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a\nvaluable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when\nthese images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable\ndetection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable\nin the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity.\nWe analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion\nmodels (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing\nwatermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are\neither erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the\nnoising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile,\ndespite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and\nefficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To\novercome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for\nIARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in\nlarge language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our\nextensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in\npreserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and\npreventing unauthorized use of their generated images.",

Previous work suggests that such tools shape people's moral\nand political judgements. However, the long-term implications of LLM-based\nsocial decision-making remain unknown. How will human cooperation be affected\nwhen the assessment of social interactions relies on language models? This is a\npressing question, as human cooperation is often driven by indirect\nreciprocity, reputations, and the capacity to judge interactions of others.\nHere, we assess how state-of-the-art LLMs judge cooperative actions. We provide\n21 different LLMs with an extensive set of examples where individuals cooperate\n-- or refuse cooperating -- in a range of social contexts, and ask how these\ninteractions should be judged. Furthermore, through an evolutionary\ngame-theoretical model, we evaluate cooperation dynamics in populations where\nthe extracted LLM-driven judgements prevail, assessing the long-term impact of\nLLMs on human prosociality. We observe a remarkable agreement in evaluating\ncooperation against good opponents. On the other hand, we notice within- and\nbetween-model variance when judging cooperation with ill-reputed individuals.\nWe show that the differences revealed between models can significantly impact\nthe prevalence of cooperation. Finally, we test prompts to steer LLM norms,\nshowing that such interventions can shape LLM judgements, particularly through\ngoal-oriented prompts.

    "summary": "Existing open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation methods typically supervise\n3D segmentation models by merging text-aligned features (e.g., CLIP) extracted\nfrom multi-view images onto 3D points. However, such approaches treat\nmulti-view images merely as intermediaries for transferring open-vocabulary\ninformation, overlooking their rich semantic content and cross-view\ncorrespondences, which limits model effectiveness. To address this, we propose\nPGOV3D, a novel framework that introduces a Partial-to-Global curriculum for\nimproving open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. The key innovation lies in\na two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, we pre-train the model on\npartial scenes that provide dense semantic information but relatively simple\ngeometry. These partial point clouds are derived from multi-view RGB-D inputs\nvia pixel-wise depth projection. To enable open-vocabulary learning, we\nleverage a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) and a 2D segmentation\nfoundation model to generate open-vocabulary labels for each viewpoint,\noffering rich and aligned supervision. An auxiliary inter-frame consistency\nmodule is introduced to enforce feature consistency across varying viewpoints\nand enhance spatial understanding. In the second stage, we fine-tune the model\non complete scene-level point clouds, which are sparser and structurally more\ncomplex. We aggregate the partial vocabularies associated with each scene and\ngenerate pseudo labels using the pre-trained model, effectively bridging the\nsemantic gap between dense partial observations and large-scale 3D\nenvironments. Extensive experiments on ScanNet, ScanNet200, and S3DIS\nbenchmarks demonstrate that PGOV3D achieves competitive performance in\nopen-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation.",

    "summary": "Dataset distillation (DD) condenses large datasets into compact yet\ninformative substitutes, preserving performance comparable to the original\ndataset while reducing storage, transmission costs, and computational\nconsumption. However, previous DD methods mainly focus on distilling\ninformation from images, often overlooking the semantic information inherent in\nthe data. The disregard for context hinders the model's generalization ability,\nparticularly in tasks involving complex datasets, which may result in illogical\noutputs or the omission of critical objects. In this study, we integrate\nvision-language methods into DD by introducing text prototypes to distill\nlanguage information and collaboratively synthesize data with image prototypes,\nthereby enhancing dataset distillation performance. Notably, the text\nprototypes utilized in this study are derived from descriptive text information\ngenerated by an open-source large language model.

    "summary": "This work-in-progress investigates the memorization, creativity, and nonsense\nfound in cooking recipes generated from Large Language Models (LLMs).\nPrecisely, we aim (i) to analyze memorization, creativity, and non-sense in\nLLMs using a small, high-quality set of human judgments and (ii) to evaluate\npotential approaches to automate such a human annotation in order to scale our\nstudy to hundreds of recipes. To achieve (i), we conduct a detailed human\nannotation on 20 preselected recipes generated by LLM (Mixtral), extracting\neach recipe's ingredients and step-by-step actions to assess which elements are\nmemorized--i.e., directly traceable to online sources possibly seen during\ntraining--and which arise from genuine creative synthesis or outright nonsense.\nWe find that Mixtral consistently reuses ingredients that can be found in\nonline documents, potentially seen during model training, suggesting strong\nreliance on memorized content. To achieve aim (ii) and scale our analysis\nbeyond small sample sizes and single LLM validation, we design an\n``LLM-as-judge'' pipeline that automates recipe generation, nonsense detection,\nparsing ingredients and recipe steps, and their annotation. For instance,\ncomparing its output against human annotations, the best ingredient extractor\nand annotator is Llama 3.1+Gemma 2 9B, achieving up to 78% accuracy on\ningredient matching. This automated framework enables large-scale\nquantification of memorization, creativity, and nonsense in generated recipes,\nproviding rigorous evidence of the models' creative capacities.",

However, this task remains challenging due to the inherent ambiguity\nof chemical language and the high cost of human annotation required for\ndeveloping reliable computer-aided extraction protocols. Here, we present\nChemActor, a fully fine-tuned large language model (LLM), as a chemical\nexecutor to convert between unstructured experimental procedures and structured\naction sequences. We propose a sequential LLM-generated data framework to\naddress the challenges of insufficient and low-quality annotated data. This\nframework integrates a data selection module that selects data based on\ndistribution divergence, with a general-purpose LLM, to generate\nmachine-executable actions from a single molecule input. Additionally, we\nintroduce a novel multi-round LLMs circle review metric, which reflects the\nmodel's advanced understanding of chemical experimental procedures. Extensive\nexperiments on reaction-to-description (R2D) and description-to-action (D2A)\ntasks demonstrate that ChemActor, augmented by LLM-generated data, achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance, outperforming the baseline model by 10%.

    "summary": "Post-training algorithms such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and\nReinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) are widely used to adapt multimodal large\nlanguage models to downstream tasks. While effective at task adaptation, their\nimpact on prior knowledge remains unclear. In this paper, we introduce jigsaw\npuzzles as a novel task absent from existing pretraining corpora and\nsystematically study the behavior of SFT and RFT on an open-source multimodal\nmodel, Qwen2.5-VL. Our experiments reveal a sharp trade-off: SFT enables rapid\ntask acquisition but leads to catastrophic forgetting, whereas RFT learns more\nslowly on novel tasks but maintains prior knowledge. We analyze this phenomenon\nthrough the lens of learning dynamics, showing that RFT reinforces correct\nsamples that are naturally aligned with the base model's probability landscape,\nmitigating interference with prior knowledge. Moreover, supervised training on\ncorrect RFT-simulated rollouts allows SFT to preserve knowledge while rapidly\nlearning new tasks. These findings suggest that data distribution, rather than\nalgorithmic differences, plays a central role in forgetting, and highlight\nRFT's potential for stable continual learning in multimodal large language\nmodels.",

Due to image-level\nvisual-language alignment, CLIP falls short in understanding fine-grained\ndetails such as object attributes and spatial relationships between objects.\nRecent efforts have attempted to compel CLIP to acquire structured visual\nrepresentations by introducing prompt learning to achieve object-level\nalignment. While achieving promising results, they still lack the capability to\nperceive actions, which are crucial for describing the states or relationships\nbetween objects. Therefore, we propose to endow CLIP with fine-grained\naction-level understanding by introducing an LLM-enhanced action-aware\nmulti-modal prompt-tuning method, incorporating the action-related external\nknowledge generated by large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we design an\naction triplet prompt and an action state prompt to exploit compositional\nsemantic knowledge and state-related causal knowledge implicitly stored in\nLLMs. Subsequently, we propose an adaptive interaction module to aggregate\nattentive visual features conditioned on action-aware prompted knowledge for\nestablishing discriminative and action-aware visual representations, which\nfurther improves the performance.

However, ambiguous or low-confidence predictions still\nrequire frequent offloading to the LLM, leading to significant communication\noverhead in bandwidth-constrained settings. To address this, we propose FedHLM,\na communication-efficient HLM framework that integrates uncertainty-aware\ninference with Federated Learning (FL). FedHLM's key innovation lies in\ncollaboratively learning token-level uncertainty thresholds that govern when\nLLM assistance is needed. Rather than using static or manually tuned\nthresholds, FedHLM employs FL to optimize these thresholds in a\nprivacy-preserving, distributed manner. Additionally, it leverages\nembedding-based token representations for Peer-to-Peer (P2P) resolution,\nenabling clients to reuse tokens inferred by semantically similar peers without\nengaging the LLM. We further introduce hierarchical model aggregation: edge\nservers refine local routing policies through client updates, while\ncross-cluster coordination aligns global decision boundaries. This layered\ndesign captures recurring uncertainty patterns, reducing redundant LLM queries.\nExperiments on large-scale news classification tasks show that FedHLM reduces\nLLM transmissions by over 95 percent with negligible accuracy loss, making it\nwell-suited for scalable and efficient edge-AI applications.",

    "summary": "Past work has studied the effects of fine-tuning on large language models'\n(LLMs) overall performance on certain tasks. However, a quantitative and\nsystematic method for analyzing its effect on individual outputs is still\nlacking. Here, we propose a new method for measuring the contribution that\nfine-tuning makes to individual LLM responses, assuming access to the original\npre-trained model. Our method tracks the model's intermediate hidden states,\nproviding a more fine-grained insight into the effects of fine-tuning than a\nsimple comparison of final outputs from pre-trained and fine-tuned models. We\nintroduce and theoretically analyze an exact decomposition of any fine-tuned\nLLM into a pre-training component and a fine-tuning component. Empirically, we\nfind that model behavior and performance can be steered by up- or down-scaling\nthe fine-tuning component during the forward pass. Motivated by this finding\nand our theoretical analysis, we define the Tuning Contribution (TuCo) as the\nratio of the magnitudes of the fine-tuning component to the pre-training\ncomponent. We observe that three prominent adversarial attacks on LLMs\ncircumvent safety measures in a way that reduces TuCo, and that TuCo is\nconsistently lower on prompts where these attacks succeed compared to those\nwhere they do not. This suggests that attenuating the effect of fine-tuning on\nmodel outputs plays a role in the success of such attacks. In summary, TuCo\nenables the quantitative study of how fine-tuning influences model behavior and\nsafety, and vice versa.",

    "title": "Exposing and Mitigating Calibration Biases and Demographic Unfairness in\n  MLLM Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Image Classification",
    "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform\nfew-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However,\nsafe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an\nin-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated\ncalibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In\nthis work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and\ndemographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot\nin-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an\ninference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases.\nSpecifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by\ncalibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the\npopulation level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this\nestimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference.\nExperimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image\nclassification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for\nchest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair\nconfidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall\nprediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.

    "title": "Corrupted by Reasoning: Reasoning Language Models Become Free-Riders in\n  Public Goods Games",
    "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous\nagents, understanding their cooperation and social mechanisms is becoming\nincreasingly important. In particular, how LLMs balance self-interest and\ncollective well-being is a critical challenge for ensuring alignment,\nrobustness, and safe deployment. In this paper, we examine the challenge of\ncostly sanctioning in multi-agent LLM systems, where an agent must decide\nwhether to invest its own resources to incentivize cooperation or penalize\ndefection. To study this, we adapt a public goods game with institutional\nchoice from behavioral economics, allowing us to observe how different LLMs\nnavigate social dilemmas over repeated interactions. Our analysis reveals four\ndistinct behavioral patterns among models: some consistently establish and\nsustain high levels of cooperation, others fluctuate between engagement and\ndisengagement, some gradually decline in cooperative behavior over time, and\nothers rigidly follow fixed strategies regardless of outcomes. Surprisingly, we\nfind that reasoning LLMs, such as the o1 series, struggle significantly with\ncooperation, whereas some traditional LLMs consistently achieve high levels of\ncooperation. These findings suggest that the current approach to improving\nLLMs, which focuses on enhancing their reasoning capabilities, does not\nnecessarily lead to cooperation, providing valuable insights for deploying LLM\nagents in environments that require sustained collaboration.

Time series foundation models\nrepresent a significant extension of this paradigm, demonstrating exceptional\nexpressive power, generalization, and cross-domain transferability. However,\nthis gives rise to a fundamental paradox: time series data reflect distinct\ndynamical systems, making cross-domain transfer intuitively implausible, yet\nthis is contradicted by the models' empirical success. To resolve this paradox,\nthis paper investigates, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives,\nthe representation learning mechanisms and generalization capabilities of\npatch-based time series foundation models. We argue that such models are not\nmerely applying a new architecture but are fundamentally generalizing the\nrepresentation paradigm of language models by extending deterministic\nvector-based representations to latent probabilistic distributional forms. Our\ntheoretical analysis supports this framework by demonstrating that continuous\ntime-series patches can be faithfully quantized into a discrete vocabulary\nwhose key statistical properties are highly consistent with those of natural\nlanguage. This generalization allows time series models to inherit the robust\nrepresentation and transfer abilities of large language models, thereby\nexplaining their superior performance in temporal tasks. Ultimately, our work\nprovides a rigorous theoretical cornerstone for understanding, evaluating, and\nimproving the safety and reliability of large-scale time series foundation\nmodels.",

While recent work\nexplores bypassing this cost with AI feedback, these methods often lack a\nrigorous theoretical foundation. In this paper, we discover that a powerful\ngeneralist reward model is already latently present within any LLM trained via\nstandard next-token prediction. We prove that this endogenous reward is not a\nheuristic, but is theoretically equivalent to a reward function learned through\noffline inverse reinforcement learning. This connection allows us to directly\nelicit a high-quality reward signal from a base (pre-trained or supervised\nfine-tuned) model without any further training. Critically, we also prove that\nsubsequent reinforcement learning using this endogenous reward leads to a\npolicy with a provably superior error bound compared to the base model. To our\nbest knowledge, this is the first theoretical proof of the effectiveness of\nreinforcement learning for LLMs. Our experiments validate this theory,\ndemonstrating that our method not only outperforms existing LLM-as-a-judge\napproaches but can also surpass explicitly trained reward models.

    "summary": "Urban research involves a wide range of scenarios and tasks that require the\nunderstanding of multi-modal data. Current methods often focus on specific data\ntypes and lack a unified framework in urban field for processing them\ncomprehensively. The recent success of multi-modal large language models\n(MLLMs) presents a promising opportunity to overcome this limitation. In this\npaper, we introduce $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, a multi-modal large language model\ndesigned to process these four types of data simultaneously and achieve strong\nperformance across diverse urban tasks compared with general MLLMs. In\n$\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$, we first curate a diverse urban instruction dataset\nencompassing both single-modal and cross-modal urban data, spanning from\nlocation view to global view of urban environment. Additionally, we propose a\nmulti-stage training framework that decouples spatial reasoning enhancement\nfrom domain knowledge learning, thereby improving the compatibility and\ndownstream performance of $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ across diverse urban tasks.\nFinally, we also extend existing benchmark for urban research to assess the\nperformance of MLLMs across a wide range of urban tasks. Experimental results\nfrom three cities demonstrate that $\\textit{UrbanLLaVA}$ outperforms\nopen-source and proprietary MLLMs in both single-modal tasks and complex\ncross-modal tasks and shows robust generalization abilities across cities.\nSource codes and data are openly accessible to the research community via\nhttps://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UrbanLLaVA.",

We propose the Learning-to-Context Slope (LCS), a novel metric that\nquantifies ICL effectiveness by modeling the slope between learning gain (loss\ndecrease from demonstrations) and contextual relevance (demonstration-input\nrelevance). LCS addresses key limitations of performance-based metrics: (1) it\ncaptures continuous loss changes even when outputs are incorrect, improving\nreliability; (2) its formulation attributes ICL failures to weak contextual\nalignment (inability to adapt inputs to demonstrations) or strong output\ncalibration (self-verification of correctness); and (3) it minimizes reliance\non labeled data via synthetic evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat LCS strongly correlates with performance improvements in labeled settings\nand reliably reflects true effectiveness in biased or data-scarce scenarios.\nFurther analysis reveals actionable thresholds for LCS and identifies model\ncapabilities critical to ICL success.",

In this work, we propose a RAG pipeline, capable of handling\ntables and images in documents, for technical documents that support both\nscanned and searchable formats.

Experiments on both open- and\nclosed-source MLLMs reveal persistent, context-sensitive gender biases that are\nnot evident in single-character settings. Our findings underscore the\nimportance of relationship-aware benchmarks for diagnosing subtle,\ninteraction-driven gender bias in MLLMs and provide actionable insights for\nfuture bias mitigation.",

    "summary": "Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques aim to automatically fix buggy\nprograms. Among these, Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) approaches have\nshown great promise. Recent advances demonstrate that directly leveraging LLMs\ncan achieve leading results. However, these techniques remain suboptimal in\ngenerating contextually relevant and accurate patches, as they often overlook\nrepair ingredients crucial for practical program repair. In this paper, we\npropose ReinFix, a novel framework that enables LLMs to autonomously search for\nrepair ingredients throughout both the reasoning and solution phases of bug\nfixing. In the reasoning phase, ReinFix integrates static analysis tools to\nretrieve internal ingredients, such as variable definitions, to assist the LLM\nin root cause analysis when it encounters difficulty understanding the context.\nDuring the solution phase, when the LLM lacks experience in fixing specific\nbugs, ReinFix searches for external ingredients from historical bug fixes with\nsimilar bug patterns, leveraging both the buggy code and its root cause to\nguide the LLM in identifying appropriate repair actions, thereby increasing the\nlikelihood of generating correct patches. Evaluations on two popular benchmarks\n(Defects4J V1.2 and V2.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over\nSOTA baselines. Notably, ReinFix fixes 146 bugs, which is 32 more than the\nbaselines on Defects4J V1.2. On Defects4J V2.0, ReinFix fixes 38 more bugs than\nthe SOTA. Importantly, when evaluating on the recent benchmarks that are free\nof data leakage risk, ReinFix also maintains the best performance.",

Existing methods primarily predict\nwhere drivers look by generating spatial heatmaps, but fail to capture the\ncognitive motivations behind attention allocation in specific contexts, which\nlimits deeper understanding of attention mechanisms. To bridge this gap, we\nintroduce Explainable Driver Attention Prediction, a novel task paradigm that\njointly predicts spatial attention regions (where), parses attended semantics\n(what), and provides cognitive reasoning for attention allocation (why). To\nsupport this, we present W3DA, the first large-scale explainable driver\nattention dataset. It enriches existing benchmarks with detailed semantic and\ncausal annotations across diverse driving scenarios, including normal\nconditions, safety-critical situations, and traffic accidents. We further\npropose LLada, a Large Language model-driven framework for driver attention\nprediction, which unifies pixel modeling, semantic parsing, and cognitive\nreasoning within an end-to-end architecture. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of LLada, exhibiting robust generalization across datasets\nand driving conditions.

Based on this observation, we introduce Spectra-1.1, an open suite\nof TriLMs trained on up to 1.2 trillion tokens, demonstrating sustained\nperformance gains at scale. Furthermore, to improve inference efficiency, we\npropose novel 2-bit and 1.6-bit packing schemes for ternary weights, which\ndemonstrate accelerated inference across various CPU architectures.

Our empirical analysis reveals that RAG-ability remains low across\nmost LLMs, highlighting significant challenges in entity retention and context\nfidelity. This paper introduces Radiant (Retrieval AugmenteD entIty-context\nAligNmenT), a novel framework that merges RAG with alignment designed to\noptimize the interplay between retrieved evidence and generated content.\nRadiant extends Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to teach LLMs how to\nintegrate provided additional information into subsequent generations. As a\nbehavior correction mechanism, Radiant boosts RAG performance across varied\nretrieval scenarios, such as noisy web contexts, knowledge conflicts, and\nhallucination reduction. This enables more reliable, contextually grounded, and\nfactually coherent content generation.",

While conventional\nantidepressant therapies have provided relief for many individuals, their\nlimitations including delayed onset of action, significant side effects, and\ntreatment resistance in a substantial portion of patients have prompted\nresearchers and healthcare providers to explore alternative therapeutic\napproaches (Kasneci et al.). African traditional medicine, with its rich\nheritage of plant-based remedies developed over millennia, offers a valuable\nresource for developing novel antidepressant treatments that may address some\nof these limitations. This paper examines the integration of large language\nmodels with African natural products for depression support, combining\ntraditional knowledge with modern artificial intelligence technology to create\naccessible, evidence-based mental health support systems.\n  The research presented here encompasses a comprehensive analysis of African\nmedicinal plants with documented antidepressant properties, their\npharmacological mechanisms, and the development of an AI-powered support system\nthat leverages DeepSeek's advanced language model capabilities. The system\nprovides evidence-based information about African herbal medicines, their\nclinical applications, safety considerations, and therapeutic protocols while\nmaintaining scientific rigor and appropriate safety standards. Our findings\ndemonstrate the potential for large language models to serve as bridges between\ntraditional knowledge and modern healthcare, offering personalized, culturally\nappropriate depression support that honors both traditional wisdom and\ncontemporary medical understanding.",

This\nresearch presents a complex framework that leverages Data Science\nmethodologies, notably Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) techniques, to improve the efficiency of analyzing Calcutta\nHigh Court verdicts.

By fine-tuning the Pegasus model\nusing case head note summaries, we achieve significant improvements in the\nsummarization of legal cases. Our two-step summarizing technique preserves\ncrucial legal contexts, allowing for the production of a comprehensive vector\ndatabase for RAG. The RAG-powered framework efficiently retrieves similar cases\nin response to user queries, offering thorough overviews and summaries.

Moreover, prior work has limited\nconsideration of the diversity in algorithm types and difficulty levels.\nObjective: In this study, we aim to evaluate and improve LLMs in solving\nreal-world competitive programming problems. Methods: We initially collect 117\nproblems from nine regional ICPC/CCPC contests held in 2024 and design four\nfiltering criteria to construct a curated benchmark consisting of 80 problems.\nLeveraging DeepSeek-R1 as the LLM, we evaluate its competitive program\ngeneration capabilities through the online judge (OJ) platforms, guided by a\ncarefully designed basic prompt. For incorrect submissions, we construct a\nfine-grained error taxonomy and then propose a targeted improvement framework\nby combining a multi-turn dialogue-based repair phase and an\ninformation-augmented regeneration phase.

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong performance in\nvideo understanding tasks. However, they continue to struggle with long-form\nvideos because of an inefficient perception of temporal intervals. Unlike\nhumans, who can dynamically adjust their temporal focus to locate\nquery-relevant moments, current MLLMs often rely on dense, uniform sampling\nacross the video timeline, leading to high memory consumption and a risk of\nmissing crucial information. To address this challenge, we introduce Temporal\nSearch, a training-free framework that enables MLLMs to explore temporal\nregions for improved long video understanding iteratively. TS is based on a key\nobservation: the model's generation confidence across different temporal\nintervals is highly correlated with prediction accuracy. TS operates through\ntwo main iterative stages. First, the MLLM proposes a temporal interval that is\nlikely to contain task-relevant information. Then, it samples a fixed number of\nframes from the interval, regardless of length, and feeds them into the model\nto produce a refined response and confidence score. TS refines the focus of the\nmodel by iteratively shifting attention to more fine-grained temporal\nintervals, improving its understanding of long videos. Additionally,\nkeyframe-level descriptions are collected to facilitate cross-interval\nperception throughout the video. To further improve efficiency, we introduce\nTS-BFS, a best-first search strategy over a tree. Each node represents a\ncandidate interval and is expanded via two methods: self-driven proposals and\nuniform partitioning. Nodes are scored based on confidence and self-evaluation,\nand the most promising one is selected for continued exploration.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable reasoning\nabilities in various tasks such as mathematics and coding. However, recent\nstudies indicate that even the best models lack true comprehension of their\nreasoning processes. In this paper, we explore how self-play can enhance the\nrationality of models in the reasoning process without supervision from humans\nor superior models. We design a Critic-Discernment Game(CDG) in which a prover\nfirst provides a solution to a given problem and is subsequently challenged by\ncritiques of its solution. These critiques either aim to assist or mislead the\nprover. The objective of the prover is to maintain the correct answer when\nfaced with misleading comments, while correcting errors in response to\nconstructive feedback. Our experiments on tasks involving mathematical\nreasoning, stepwise error detection, self-correction, and long-chain reasoning\ndemonstrate that CDG training can significantly improve the ability of\nwell-aligned LLMs to comprehend their reasoning process.",

To systematically mitigate this issue,\nwe propose DeSa2VA, a decoupling-enhanced prompting scheme integrating text\npre-training and a linear decoupling module to address the information\nprocessing limitations inherent in SAM-2. Specifically, first, we devise a\npre-training paradigm that converts textual ground-truth labels into\npoint-level prompts while generating corresponding text masks. These masks are\nrefined through a hybrid loss function to strengthen the model's semantic\ngrounding capabilities. Next, we employ linear projection to disentangle hidden\nstates that generated by a large language model into distinct textual and\nvisual feature subspaces. Finally, a dynamic mask fusion strategy\nsynergistically combines these decoupled features through triple supervision\nfrom predicted text/visual masks and ground-truth annotations.

    "summary": "This position paper aims to rethink the role and design of memory in Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based agent systems. We observe that while current memory\npractices have begun to transcend the limitations of single interactions, they\nremain conceptually grounded in \"bound memory\" in terms of design concept-where\nmemory is treated as local state attached to specific context or entities,\nforming \"memory silos\" that impede cross-entity collaboration. To overcome this\narchitectural bottleneck, this paper proposes the timely design perspective of\n\"Memory as a Service\" (MaaS). MaaS advocates decoupling memory from its\nconventional role as an interaction byproduct and encapsulating it as a modular\nservice that can be independently callable, dynamically composable, and finely\ngoverned. At its core, MaaS leverages the duality of memory-its inherently\nprivate nature and its potential for public service-to grant memory controlled,\non-demand interoperability across entities. This paper introduces a\ntwo-dimensional design space defined by entity structure and service type,\nillustrating how MaaS aligns with current memory practices while naturally\nextending them to cross-entity collaborative scenarios. Finally, we outline an\nopen research agenda spanning governance, security, and ethical ecosystems, and\ncall upon the broader research community to explore this shift toward\nservice-oriented memory for collaborative agents operating across entity\nboundaries.",

    "summary": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is widely used to align large language models\n(LLMs) with information extraction (IE) tasks, such as named entity recognition\n(NER). However, annotating such fine-grained labels and training\ndomain-specific models is costly. Existing works typically train a unified\nmodel across multiple domains, but such approaches lack adaptation and\nscalability since not all training data benefits target domains and scaling\ntrained models remains challenging. We propose the SaM framework, which\ndynamically Selects and Merges expert models at inference time. Specifically,\nfor a target domain, we select domain-specific experts pre-trained on existing\ndomains based on (i) domain similarity to the target domain and (ii)\nperformance on sampled instances, respectively. The experts are then merged to\ncreate task-specific models optimized for the target domain. By dynamically\nmerging experts beneficial to target domains, we improve generalization across\nvarious domains without extra training. Additionally, experts can be added or\nremoved conveniently, leading to great scalability. Extensive experiments on\nmultiple benchmarks demonstrate our framework's effectiveness, which\noutperforms the unified model by an average of 10%. We further provide insights\ninto potential improvements, practical experience, and extensions of our\nframework.",

Furthermore, RoboPearls employs a vision-language\nmodel (VLM) to analyze robotic learning issues to close the simulation loop for\nperformance enhancement.

This paper presents FairMarket-RL, a novel\nhybrid framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to enable fairness-aware trading agents. In a simulated P2P\nmicrogrid with multiple sellers and buyers, the LLM acts as a real-time\nfairness critic, evaluating each trading episode using two metrics:\nFairness-To-Buyer (FTB) and Fairness-Between-Sellers (FBS). These fairness\nscores are integrated into agent rewards through scheduled\n{\\lambda}-coefficients, forming an adaptive LLM-guided reward shaping loop that\nreplaces brittle, rule-based fairness constraints. Agents are trained using\nIndependent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) and achieve equitable outcomes,\nfulfilling over 90% of buyer demand, maintaining fair seller margins, and\nconsistently reaching FTB and FBS scores above 0.80. The training process\ndemonstrates that fairness feedback improves convergence, reduces buyer\nshortfalls, and narrows profit disparities between sellers. With its\nlanguage-based critic, the framework scales naturally, and its extension to a\nlarge power distribution system with household prosumers illustrates its\npractical applicability.

    "title": "Beyond Code: The Multidimensional Impacts of Large Language Models in\n  Software Development",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are poised to significantly impact software\ndevelopment, especially in the Open-Source Software (OSS) sector. To understand\nthis impact, we first outline the mechanisms through which LLMs may influence\nOSS through code development, collaborative knowledge transfer, and skill\ndevelopment. We then empirically examine how LLMs affect OSS developers' work\nin these three key areas. Leveraging a natural experiment from a temporary\nChatGPT ban in Italy, we employ a Difference-in-Differences framework with\ntwo-way fixed effects to analyze data from all OSS developers on GitHub in\nthree similar countries, Italy, France, and Portugal, totaling 88,022 users. We\nfind that access to ChatGPT increases developer productivity by 6.4%, knowledge\nsharing by 9.6%, and skill acquisition by 8.4%. These benefits vary\nsignificantly by user experience level: novice developers primarily experience\nproductivity gains, whereas more experienced developers benefit more from\nimproved knowledge sharing and accelerated skill acquisition. In addition, we\nfind that LLM-assisted learning is highly context-dependent, with the greatest\nbenefits observed in technically complex, fragmented, or rapidly evolving\ncontexts. We show that the productivity effects of LLMs extend beyond direct\ncode generation to include enhanced collaborative learning and knowledge\nexchange among developers, dynamics that are essential for gaining a holistic\nunderstanding of LLMs' impact in OSS. Our findings offer critical managerial\nimplications: strategically deploying LLMs can accelerate novice developers'\nonboarding and productivity, empower intermediate developers to foster\nknowledge sharing and collaboration, and support rapid skill acquisition,\ntogether enhancing long-term organizational productivity and agility.",

P4OMP leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with\nstructured instructional knowledge from OpenMP tutorials to improve the\nreliability of prompt-driven code generation.

We evaluate P4OMP against a baseline,\nGPT-3.5-Turbo without retrieval, on a comprehensive benchmark of 108 real-world\nC++ programs drawn from Stack Overflow, PolyBench, and NAS benchmark suites.\nP4OMP achieves 100% compilation success on all parallelizable cases, while the\nbaseline fails to compile in 20 out of 108 cases. Six cases that rely on\nnon-random-access iterators or thread-unsafe constructs are excluded due to\nfundamental OpenMP limitations. A detailed analysis demonstrates how P4OMP\nconsistently avoids scoping errors, syntactic misuse, and invalid directive\ncombinations that commonly affect baseline-generated code.

However, it remains unclear whether these\nimprovements are driven by major changes in transformer layers or from minor\nadjustments that leave the relative layer importance structures of the base\nmodel largely unchanged. We investigate this question through systematic\nlayer-wise ablation experiments, examining base, instruction-tuned,\nknowledge-distilled, and reinforcement learning variants on mathematical\nreasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that mathematical reasoning gives rise\nto a specific layer importance structure, and this structure persists across\nall post-training paradigms. Removal of such layers causes accuracy drops of up\nto 80%. In contrast, non-mathematical tasks like factual recall exhibit no\ncritical layers. This distinction suggests that mathematical reasoning requires\nspecialized layers that emerge during pre-training, while other non-reasoning\ntasks do not. From an information-theoretic perspective, we also observe that\nthese critical layers are the same layers where major representational\ntransformation occurs.",

    "summary": "The growing capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have exposed them to\nincreasingly sophisticated jailbreak attacks. Among these, obfuscation-based\nattacks -- which encrypt malicious content to evade detection -- remain highly\neffective. By leveraging the reasoning ability of advanced LLMs to interpret\nencrypted prompts, such attacks circumvent conventional defenses that rely on\nkeyword detection or context filtering. These methods are very difficult to\ndefend against, as existing safety mechanisms are not designed to interpret or\ndecode ciphered content. In this work, we propose \\textbf{MetaCipher}, a novel\nobfuscation-based jailbreak framework, along with a reinforcement\nlearning-based dynamic cipher selection mechanism that adaptively chooses\noptimal encryption strategies from a cipher pool. This approach enhances\njailbreak effectiveness and generalizability across diverse task types, victim\nLLMs, and safety guardrails. Our framework is modular and extensible by design,\nsupporting arbitrary cipher families and accommodating evolving adversarial\nstrategies. We complement our method with a large-scale empirical analysis of\ncipher performance across multiple victim LLMs. Within as few as 10 queries,\nMetaCipher achieves over 92\\% attack success rate (ASR) on most recent standard\nmalicious prompt benchmarks against state-of-the-art non-reasoning LLMs, and\nover 74\\% ASR against reasoning-capable LLMs, outperforming all existing\nobfuscation-based jailbreak methods. These results highlight the long-term\nrobustness and adaptability of our approach, making it more resilient than\nprior methods in the face of advancing safety measures.",

Existing approaches -- such as pruning, quantization, early exits,\nand speculative decoding -- often require retraining, architectural changes, or\ndisrupt decoding compatibility. We introduce QuickSilver, a modular,\ntoken-level framework that enables semantic adaptivity at inference time\nwithout altering model weights or structure. QuickSilver integrates four\nsynergistic mechanisms:\n  (i) Dynamic Token Halting, which halts computation for tokens with converged\nrepresentations; (ii) KV Cache Skipping, which selectively suppresses memory\nwrites to reduce attention overhead; and (iii) Contextual Token Fusion, which\ncollapses redundant tokens into shared paths to shrink sequence length.\n  Unlike speculative decoding or MoE routing, QuickSilver operates entirely on\nfrozen, dense models and requires no auxiliary networks. Applied to GPT-2 and\nLlama-2 across WikiText-103 and C4, QuickSilver achieves up to 39.6% FLOP\nreduction with negligible perplexity degradation (<=0.2).",

In this paper, we analyze 686 developer-ChatGPT\nconversations shared within GitHub issue threads to identify characteristics\nthat make these conversations effective for issue resolution. First, we analyze\nthe conversations and their corresponding issues to distinguish helpful from\nunhelpful conversations. We begin by categorizing the types of tasks developers\nseek help with to better understand the scenarios in which ChatGPT is most\neffective. Next, we examine a wide range of conversational, project, and\nissue-related metrics to uncover factors associated with helpful conversations.\nFinally, we identify common deficiencies in unhelpful ChatGPT responses to\nhighlight areas that could inform the design of more effective developer-facing\ntools.

However, due to their inherent token-by-token processing and\nlimited capacity for maintaining extended context, LLMs struggle to fulfill\ntelecom-specific requirements such as cross-layer dependency cascades (i.e.,\nover OSI), temporal-spatial fault correlation, and real-time distributed\ncoordination. In contrast, Large Concept Models (LCMs), which reason at the\nabstraction level of semantic concepts rather than individual lexical tokens,\noffer a fundamentally superior approach for addressing these telecom\nchallenges. By employing hyperbolic latent spaces for hierarchical\nrepresentation and encapsulating complex multi-layered network interactions\nwithin concise concept embeddings, LCMs overcome critical shortcomings of LLMs\nin terms of memory efficiency, cross-layer correlation, and native multimodal\nintegration. This paper argues that adopting LCMs is not simply an incremental\nstep, but a necessary evolutionary leap toward achieving robust and effective\nAI-driven telecom management.",

    "summary": "Text watermarks in large language models (LLMs) are an increasingly important\ntool for detecting synthetic text and distinguishing human-written content from\nLLM-generated text. While most existing studies focus on determining whether\nentire texts are watermarked, many real-world scenarios involve mixed-source\ntexts, which blend human-written and watermarked content. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of optimally estimating the watermark proportion in\nmixed-source texts. We cast this problem as estimating the proportion parameter\nin a mixture model based on \\emph{pivotal statistics}. First, we show that this\nparameter is not even identifiable in certain watermarking schemes, let alone\nconsistently estimable. In stark contrast, for watermarking methods that employ\ncontinuous pivotal statistics for detection, we demonstrate that the proportion\nparameter is identifiable under mild conditions. We propose efficient\nestimators for this class of methods, which include several popular unbiased\nwatermarks as examples, and derive minimax lower bounds for any measurable\nestimator based on pivotal statistics, showing that our estimators achieve\nthese lower bounds. Through evaluations on both synthetic data and mixed-source\ntext generated by open-source models, we demonstrate that our proposed\nestimators consistently achieve high estimation accuracy.",

    "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) encode visual inputs as dense sequences\nof patch-level tokens to capture fine-grained semantics. These visual tokens\noften outnumber their textual counterparts by a large margin, leading to\nsubstantial computational overhead and limiting the scalability of LVLMs in\npractice. Previous efforts have explored visual token reduction either prior to\nor within the large language models (LLM). However, most in-LLM reduction\napproaches rely on text-conditioned interactions, implicitly assuming that\ntextual tokens can reliably capture the importance of visual tokens. In this\nwork, we revisit this assumption and reveal causal, semantic, and spatial forms\nof cross-modal misalignment. These misalignments undermine the effectiveness of\ntext-guided visual token reduction. To address this, we introduce VisionDrop, a\ntraining-free, visual-only pruning framework that selects informative visual\ntokens based on intra-modal (visual-to-visual) attention, without relying on\ntextual signals. To further suppress redundancy throughout the model hierarchy,\nwe treat the visual encoder and the LLM as a unified system and design a\nprogressive pruning pipeline. Our method performs dominant token selection and\nlightweight contextual merging at multiple stages, enabling fine-grained visual\ninformation to be retained even under aggressive token budgets. Extensive\nexperiments across diverse benchmarks show that VisionDrop achieves consistent\nimprovements over existing methods, despite requiring no additional training or\ncomplex modifications.

    "title": "Training Language Model to Critique for Better Refinement",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable evaluation and\ncritique capabilities, providing insightful feedback and identifying flaws in\nvarious tasks. However, limited research has explored which types of critiques\nare most effective for improving model responses or how to generate such\ncritiques. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{R}efinement-oriented\n\\textbf{C}ritique \\textbf{O}ptimization (RCO), a novel framework designed to\ntrain critic models using refinement signals. RCO uses a feedback loop where\ncritiques, generated by the critic model, guide the actor model in refining its\nresponses. The critique utility (CU) quantifies the effectiveness of these\nrefinements, serving as the reward signal for training the critic model. By\nfocusing on critiques that lead to better refinements, RCO eliminates the need\nfor direct critique preference assessment, ensuring that critiques driving\nmeaningful improvements are rewarded. We evaluate RCO across five tasks, i.e.,\ndialog generation, summarization, question answering, mathematical reasoning,\nand code generation, and show that it significantly outperforms traditional\nmethods and open-source models in terms of critique quality and refinement\noutcomes. Our contributions include the introduction of RCO, a novel\nsupervision scheme based on refined response preferences, and comprehensive\nexperimental results that highlight the method's effectiveness in enhancing LLM\ncritique-refinement loops.",

    "summary": "With the deep penetration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the\ntransportation sector, intelligent cockpits, autonomous driving, and\nintelligent road networks are developing at an unprecedented pace. However, the\ndata ecosystems of these three key areas are increasingly fragmented and\nincompatible. Especially, existing testing methods rely on data stacking, fail\nto cover all edge cases, and lack flexibility. To address this issue, this\npaper introduces the concept of \"Query as Test\" (QaT). This concept shifts the\nfocus from rigid, prescripted test cases to flexible, on-demand logical queries\nagainst a unified data representation. Specifically, we identify the need for a\nfundamental improvement in data storage and representation, leading to our\nproposal of \"Extensible Scenarios Notations\" (ESN). ESN is a novel declarative\ndata framework based on Answer Set Programming (ASP), which uniformly\nrepresents heterogeneous multimodal data from the cockpit, vehicle, and road as\na collection of logical facts and rules. This approach not only achieves deep\nsemantic fusion of data, but also brings three core advantages: (1) supports\ncomplex and flexible semantic querying through logical reasoning; (2) provides\nnatural interpretability for decision-making processes; (3) allows for\non-demand data abstraction through logical rules, enabling fine-grained privacy\nprotection. We further elaborate on the QaT paradigm, transforming the\nfunctional validation and safety compliance checks of autonomous driving\nsystems into logical queries against the ESN database, significantly enhancing\nthe expressiveness and formal rigor of the testing. Finally, we introduce the\nconcept of \"Validation-Driven Development\" (VDD), which suggests to guide\ndevelopments by logical validation rather than quantitative testing in the era\nof Large Language Models, in order to accelerating the iteration and\ndevelopment process.",

Notable linguistic patterns in\nMT outputs are shorter sentence lengths and increased use of adversative\nconjunctions. Comparing LLMs and NMTs, we achieve approximately 70%\nclassification accuracy, with LLMs exhibiting greater lexical diversity and\nNMTs using more brackets.

    "summary": "Modern Large Language Models, such as the LLaMA, Qwen and DeepSeek series,\npredominantly adopt the Pre-LayerNorm (Pre-LN) Transformer architecture. While\nbeing stable during pretraining and scalable to large model sizes, Pre-LN\nsuffers from an exponential growth in activation variance across layers,\ncausing the shortcut to dominate over sub-layer outputs in the residual\nconnection and limiting the learning capacity of deeper layers. To mitigate\nthis issue, we propose Gradient-Preserving Activation Scaling (GPAS), a simple\ntechnique that can be used in combination with existing approaches. GPAS works\nby scaling down the intermediate activations while keeping their gradients\nunchanged. This leaves information in the activations intact, and avoids the\ngradient vanishing problem associated with gradient downscaling. Extensive\nexperiments across various model sizes from 71M to 1B show that GPAS achieves\nconsistent performance gains. Beyond enhancing Pre-LN Transformers, GPAS also\nshows promise in improving alternative architectures such as Sandwich-LN and\nDeepNorm, demonstrating its versatility and potential for improving training\ndynamics in a wide range of settings.

Meanwhile, GCG + WordGame matched the raw performance of\nWordGame maintaining a high ASR of over 80% even under stricter evaluators like\nMistral-Sorry-Bench. Crucially, both hybrids retained transferability and\nreliably pierced advanced defenses such as Gradient Cuff and JBShield, which\nfully blocked single-mode attacks. These findings expose previously unreported\nvulnerabilities in current safety stacks, highlight trade-offs between raw\nsuccess and defensive robustness, and underscore the need for holistic\nsafeguards against adaptive adversaries.",

While\nrecent advances in deep generative models and large language models (LLMs) have\nshown promise in structured content generation, most existing approaches lack\ngrounding in contextual design exemplars and fall short in handling semantic\nalignment and visual coherence. In this work we introduce CAL-RAG, a\nretrieval-augmented, agentic framework for content-aware layout generation that\nintegrates multimodal retrieval, large language models, and collaborative\nagentic reasoning. Our system retrieves relevant layout examples from a\nstructured knowledge base and invokes an LLM-based layout recommender to\npropose structured element placements. A vision-language grader agent evaluates\nthe layout with visual metrics, and a feedback agent provides targeted\nrefinements, enabling iterative improvement. We implement our framework using\nLangGraph and evaluate it on the PKU PosterLayout dataset, a benchmark rich in\nsemantic and structural variability. CAL-RAG achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple layout metrics -- including underlay effectiveness,\nelement alignment, and overlap -- substantially outperforming strong baselines\nsuch as LayoutPrompter. These results demonstrate that combining retrieval\naugmentation with agentic multi-step reasoning yields a scalable,\ninterpretable, and high-fidelity solution for automated layout generation.",

Phase 1 evaluates LLMs on factual questions where a single\nverifiable answer exists, assessing whether models maintain consistency across\ndifferent query languages. Phase 2 expands the scope by probing geopolitically\nsensitive disputes, where responses may reflect culturally embedded or\nideologically aligned perspectives. We construct a manually curated dataset\nspanning both factual and disputable QA, across four languages and question\ntypes.

    "summary": "Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong\nperformance in visual grounding, establishing themselves as a general interface\nfor various vision-language applications. This progress has driven the\ndevelopment of token pruning methods to mitigate the high computational costs\nassociated with processing numerous visual tokens. However, we observe that\npruning significantly weakens the model's grounding ability, leading to\nincorrect predictions and drastic performance degradation. In Referring\nExpression Comprehension (REC), for instance, pruning causes the accuracy of\nLLaVA on the RefCOCO validation set to drop from 56.14% to 15.34%. Our analysis\nidentifies misaligned position IDs after pruning as the primary cause of this\ndegradation, as both the order and value of these IDs are crucial for\nmaintaining performance in grounding tasks. To address this issue, we propose\nGrounding-Aware Token Pruning (GAP), a simple yet effective adjustment to\nposition IDs that recovers REC accuracy back to 51.42%, which is 90% of the\noriginal performance in the without pruning setting, all while requiring no\nadditional training, memory, or computational overhead. Applied to models such\nas Shikra, MiniGPTv2, and the LLaVA series, our method consistently improves\nperformance across various token pruning strategies.",

Existing proposals often use some\ndescription of the graph to create an ``augmented'' prompt fed to the LLM.

These changes are widely\nattributed to the growing influence of Large Language Models like ChatGPT in\nthe discourse surrounding bias and misalignment. However, apart from changes in\nfrequency, the exact structure of these linguistic shifts has remained unclear.\nThe present study addresses this and investigates whether these changes involve\nthe replacement of synonyms by suddenly 'spiking words,' for example, \"crucial\"\nreplacing \"essential\" and \"key,\" or whether they reflect broader semantic and\npragmatic qualifications. To further investigate structural changes, we include\npart of speech tagging in our analysis to quantify linguistic shifts over\ngrammatical categories and differentiate between word forms, like \"potential\"\nas a noun vs. as an adjective. We systematically analyze synonym groups for\nwidely discussed 'spiking words' based on frequency trends in scientific\nabstracts from PubMed. We find that entire semantic clusters often shift\ntogether, with most or all words in a group increasing in usage. This pattern\nsuggests that changes induced by Large Language Models are primarily semantic\nand pragmatic rather than purely lexical. Notably, the adjective \"important\"\nshows a significant decline, which prompted us to systematically analyze\ndecreasing lexical items. Our analysis of \"collapsing\" words reveals a more\ncomplex picture, which is consistent with organic language change and contrasts\nwith the patterns of the abrupt spikes.

This survey provides a comprehensive taxonomy of LLM-specific\nextraction attacks and defenses, categorizing attacks into functionality\nextraction, training data extraction, and prompt-targeted attacks. We analyze\nvarious attack methodologies including API-based knowledge distillation, direct\nquerying, parameter recovery, and prompt stealing techniques that exploit\ntransformer architectures. We then examine defense mechanisms organized into\nmodel protection, data privacy protection, and prompt-targeted strategies,\nevaluating their effectiveness across different deployment scenarios. We\npropose specialized metrics for evaluating both attack effectiveness and\ndefense performance, addressing the specific challenges of generative language\nmodels. Through our analysis, we identify critical limitations in current\napproaches and propose promising research directions, including integrated\nattack methodologies and adaptive defense mechanisms that balance security with\nmodel utility.

    "summary": "Generating code from natural language specifications is one of the most\nsuccessful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, they hallucinate:\nLLMs produce outputs that may be grammatically correct but are factually\nincorrect. Without an existing, correct implementation (i.e., an oracle), can\nwe quantify how likely the generated program is correct?\n  In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called incoherence,\nthat can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and provides a\nlower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program\nfor that specification is incorrect. Our experiments demonstrate an\nextraordinary effectiveness. For the average code generation task, our\nincoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of\nincorrect programs without reports of false positives. In fact, an oracle-based\nevaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation.\nIn particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by\nthe number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of\nLLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via our incoherence.",

This underscores a core challenge: the absence of structured,\nverifiable, and causally-linked historical data of scientific evolution.To\naddress this,we introduce \\textbf{THE-Tree} (\\textbf{T}echnology\n\\textbf{H}istory \\textbf{E}volution Tree), a computational framework that\nconstructs such domain-specific evolution trees from scientific literature.\nTHE-Tree employs a search algorithm to explore evolutionary paths.

We construct and validate 88 THE-Trees across diverse domains and\nrelease a benchmark dataset including up to 71k fact verifications covering 27k\npapers to foster further research.

Although visual\ncropping techniques seem promising, recent approaches have several limitations:\nthe need for task-specific fine-tuning, low efficiency due to uninformed\nexhaustive search, or incompatibility with efficient attention implementations.\nWe address these shortcomings by proposing a training-free visual cropping\nmethod, dubbed FOCUS, that leverages MLLM-internal representations to guide the\nsearch for the most relevant image region. This is accomplished in four steps:\nfirst, we identify the target object(s) in the VQA prompt; second, we compute\nan object relevance map using the key-value (KV) cache; third, we propose and\nrank relevant image regions based on the map; and finally, we perform the\nfine-grained VQA task using the top-ranked region. As a result of this informed\nsearch strategy, FOCUS achieves strong performance across four fine-grained VQA\ndatasets and two types of MLLMs. It outperforms three popular visual cropping\nmethods in both accuracy and efficiency, and matches the best-performing\nbaseline, ZoomEye, while requiring 3 - 6.5 x less compute.",

While prior studies usually train small models on a few toy or\nhighly-specific tasks for thousands of epochs, we conduct the first study of\ngrokking on checkpoints during one-pass pretraining of a 7B large language\nmodel (LLM), i.e., OLMoE. We compute the training loss and evaluate\ngeneralization on diverse benchmark tasks, including math reasoning, code\ngeneration, and commonsense/domain-specific knowledge retrieval tasks.\n  Our study, for the first time, verifies that grokking still happens in the\npretraining of large-scale foundation models, though different data may enter\ngrokking stages asynchronously. We further demystify grokking's \"emergence of\ngeneralization\" by investigating LLM internal dynamics. Specifically, we find\nthat training samples' pathways (i.e., expert choices across layers) evolve\nfrom random, instance-specific to more structured and shareable between\nsamples. Also, the complexity of a sample's pathway reduces despite the\nconverged loss. These indicate a memorization-to-generalization \"knowledge\ndigestion\", providing a mechanistic explanation of delayed generalization. In\nthe study, we develop two novel metrics to quantify pathway distance and the\ncomplexity of a single pathway. We show their ability to predict the\ngeneralization improvement on diverse downstream tasks. They are efficient,\nsimple to compute and solely dependent on training data. Hence, they have\npractical value for pretraining, enabling us to monitor the generalization\nperformance without finetuning and test. Theoretically, we show that more\nstructured pathways reduce model complexity and improve the generalization\nbound.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are powerful at integrating diverse\ndata, but they often struggle with complex reasoning. While Reinforcement\nlearning (RL) can boost reasoning in LLMs, applying it to MLLMs is tricky.\nCommon issues include a drop in performance on general tasks and the generation\nof overly detailed or \"overthinking\" reasoning. Our work investigates how the\nKL penalty and overthinking affect RL training in MLLMs. We propose Asymmetric\nPolicy Optimization (APO) to address these issues, which divides the sampled\nresponses into positive and negative groups. For positive samples,\nDifficulty-Adaptive Divergence Shaping (DADS) is introduced to dynamically\nadjust the KL divergence weight based on their difficulty. This method prevents\npolicy entropy from dropping sharply, improves training stability, utilizes\nsamples better, and preserves the model's existing knowledge. For negative\nsamples, Suboptimal Trajectory Complexity Regularization (STCR) is proposed to\npenalize overly long responses. This helps mitigate overthinking and encourages\nmore concise reasoning while preserving the model's explorative capacity. We\napply our method to Qwen2.5-VL-3B, creating View-R1-3B.

    "summary": "With the rapid development of digital technology, AI-driven psychological\ncounseling has gradually become an important research direction in the field of\nmental health. However, existing models still have deficiencies in dialogue\nsafety, detailed scenario handling, and lightweight deployment. To address\nthese issues, this study proposes PsyLite, a lightweight psychological\ncounseling large language model agent developed based on the base model\nInternLM2.5-7B-chat. Through a two-stage training strategy (hybrid distillation\ndata fine-tuning and ORPO preference optimization), PsyLite enhances the\nmodel's deep-reasoning ability, psychological counseling ability, and safe\ndialogue ability. After deployment using Ollama and Open WebUI, a custom\nworkflow is created with Pipelines. An innovative conditional RAG is designed\nto introduce crosstalk humor elements at appropriate times during psychological\ncounseling to enhance user experience and decline dangerous requests to\nstrengthen dialogue safety. Evaluations show that PsyLite outperforms the\nbaseline models in the Chinese general evaluation (CEval), psychological\ncounseling professional evaluation (CPsyCounE), and dialogue safety evaluation\n(SafeDialBench), particularly in psychological counseling professionalism\n(CPsyCounE score improvement of 47.6\\%) and dialogue safety (\\safe{} score\nimprovement of 2.4\\%). Additionally, the model uses quantization technology\n(GGUF q4\\_k\\_m) to achieve low hardware deployment (5GB memory is sufficient\nfor operation), providing a feasible solution for psychological counseling\napplications in resource-constrained environments.",

The key is to note that the\nbenchmarks used to test LLMs -- such as AP exams -- are also those used to test\npeople. However, this raises an implication: these benchmarks are only valid\ntests if LLMs misunderstand concepts in ways that mirror human\nmisunderstandings. Otherwise, success on benchmarks only demonstrates potemkin\nunderstanding: the illusion of understanding driven by answers irreconcilable\nwith how any human would interpret a concept. We present two procedures for\nquantifying the existence of potemkins: one using a specially designed\nbenchmark in three domains, the other using a general procedure that provides a\nlower-bound on their prevalence. We find that potemkins are ubiquitous across\nmodels, tasks, and domains.

    "summary": "Graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enables large language\nmodels (LLMs) to ground responses with structured external knowledge from\nup-to-date knowledge graphs (KGs) and reduce hallucinations. However, LLMs\noften rely on a weak retriever in graph-based RAG: I) Due to the lack of ground\ntruth, the retriever is often trained on weak supervision, which often\nintroduces spurious signals to the LLMs. II) Due to the abstraction of graph\ndata, the retrieved knowledge is often presented in unorganized forms. To\nmitigate the issue, we present Refined Graph-based RAG (ReG) to align weak\nretrievers to LLMs for graph-based RAG. Specifically, ReG incorporates LLM\nfeedback to get rid of spurious signals and improve the quality of the\nsupervision. Meanwhile, ReG introduces a structure-aware reorganization module\nto refactor the retrieval results into logically coherent evidence chains.\nExperiments on prominent benchmarks demonstrate that ReG significantly and\nconsistently brings improvements across different LLM backbones by up to 10%.\nThe improved supervision quality enables ReG to match the state-of-the-art\nperformance with 5% training data and to transfer to out-of-distribution KGs.\nNotably, when adopted to reasoning-based LLMs, ReG reduces the reasoning token\ncost by up to 30% and improves the performance by up to 4%.",

These shifts can obscure malicious intent or mimic normal dialogue,\nmaking accurate classification challenging. While Large Language Models (LLMs)\nshow strong performance in natural language tasks, they often struggle with\ncontextual ambiguity and hallucinations in risk-sensitive scenarios. To address\nthese challenges, we present a Domain Knowledge (DK)-Enhanced LLM framework\nthat integrates pretrained LLMs with structured, task-specific insights to\nperform fraud and concept drift detection. The proposed architecture consists\nof three main components: (1) a DK-LLM module to detect fake or deceptive\nconversations; (2) a drift detection unit (OCDD) to determine whether a\nsemantic shift has occurred; and (3) a second DK-LLM module to classify the\ndrift as either benign or fraudulent. We first validate the value of domain\nknowledge using a fake review dataset and then apply our full framework to\nSEConvo, a multiturn dialogue dataset that includes various types of fraud and\nspam attacks. Results show that our system detects fake conversations with high\naccuracy and effectively classifies the nature of drift.

    "summary": "Multimodal understanding of tables in real-world contexts is challenging due\nto the complexity of structure, symbolic density, and visual degradation (blur,\nskew, watermarking, incomplete structures or fonts, multi-span or\nhierarchically nested layouts). Existing multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs) struggle with such WildStruct conditions, resulting in limited\nperformance and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we propose\nTableMoE, a neuro-symbolic Mixture-of-Connector-Experts (MoCE) architecture\nspecifically designed for robust, structured reasoning over multimodal table\ndata. TableMoE features an innovative Neuro-Symbolic Routing mechanism, which\npredicts latent semantic token roles (e.g., header, data cell, axis, formula)\nand dynamically routes table elements to specialized experts (Table-to-HTML,\nTable-to-JSON, Table-to-Code) using a confidence-aware gating strategy informed\nby symbolic reasoning graphs. To facilitate effective alignment-driven\npretraining, we introduce the large-scale TableMoE-Align dataset, consisting of\n1.2M table-HTML-JSON-code quadruples across finance, science, biomedicine and\nindustry, utilized exclusively for model pretraining. For evaluation, we curate\nand release four challenging WildStruct benchmarks: WMMFinQA, WMMTatQA,\nWMMTabDialog, and WMMFinanceMath, designed specifically to stress-test models\nunder real-world multimodal degradation and structural complexity. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that TableMoE significantly surpasses existing\nstate-of-the-art models. Extensive ablation studies validate each core\ncomponent, emphasizing the critical role of Neuro-Symbolic Routing and\nstructured expert alignment. Through qualitative analyses, we further showcase\nTableMoE's interpretability and enhanced robustness, underscoring the\neffectiveness of integrating neuro-symbolic reasoning for multimodal table\nunderstanding.",

Clinicians routinely\nencounter diverse, specialized tasks requiring adaptation from limited\nexamples, such as drawing insights from a few relevant prior cases or\nconsidering a constrained set of differential diagnoses. While multimodal large\nlanguage models (MLLMs) have shown advances in medical visual question\nanswering (VQA), their ability to learn multimodal tasks from context is\nlargely unknown. We introduce SMMILE, the first expert-driven multimodal ICL\nbenchmark for medical tasks. Eleven medical experts curated problems, each\nincluding a multimodal query and multimodal in-context examples as task\ndemonstrations. SMMILE encompasses 111 problems (517 question-image-answer\ntriplets) covering 6 medical specialties and 13 imaging modalities. We further\nintroduce SMMILE++, an augmented variant with 1038 permuted problems. A\ncomprehensive evaluation of 15 MLLMs demonstrates that most models exhibit\nmoderate to poor multimodal ICL ability in medical tasks. In open-ended\nevaluations, ICL contributes only 8% average improvement over zero-shot on\nSMMILE and 9.4% on SMMILE++. We observe a susceptibility for irrelevant\nin-context examples: even a single noisy or irrelevant example can degrade\nperformance by up to 9.5%. Moreover, example ordering exhibits a recency bias,\ni.e., placing the most relevant example last can lead to substantial\nperformance improvements by up to 71%. Our findings highlight critical\nlimitations and biases in current MLLMs when learning multimodal medical tasks\nfrom context.",

    "summary": "With the rapid evolution of multimodal large language models, the capacity to\ndeeply understand and interpret human intentions has emerged as a critical\ncapability, which demands detailed and thoughtful reasoning. In recent studies,\nReinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated potential in enhancing the\nreasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Nonetheless, the\nchallenges associated with adapting RL to multimodal data and formats remain\nlargely unaddressed. In this paper, we identify two issues in existing\nmultimodal reasoning models: insufficient global context understanding and\nshortcut problems. Insufficient context understanding can happen when a model\nmisinterprets multimodal context, resulting in incorrect answers. The shortcut\nproblem occurs when the model overlooks crucial clues in multimodal inputs,\ndirectly addressing the query without considering the multimodal information.\nTo tackle these issues, we emphasize the necessity for the model to reason with\na clear understanding of the global context within multimodal inputs. This\nglobal context understanding can effectively prevent the model from overlooking\nkey multimodal cues and ensure a thorough reasoning process. To ensure the\naccurate interpretation of multimodal context information, we implement a\ncontext reward judged by a large language model, alongside format and accuracy\nrewards. Additionally, to improve complex reasoning capability, we employ the\nLLM to assess the logical reward, determining whether the reasoning process\nsuccessfully integrates multimodal information with logical methods. We also\nintroduce a reasoning omni-modal benchmark, IntentBench, aimed at evaluating\nmodels in understanding complex human intentions and emotions. Our proposed\nmethod demonstrates advanced performance across multiple omni-modal benchmarks\ncompared to other open-source omni-modal models.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) trained on text demonstrated remarkable results\non natural language processing (NLP) tasks. These models have been adapted to\ndecipher the language of DNA, where sequences of nucleotides act as \"words\"\nthat encode genomic functions. However, the genome differs fundamentally from\nnatural language, as it lacks clearly defined words or a consistent grammar.\nAlthough DNA language models (DNALMs) such as DNABERT, GENA-LM have achieved\nhigh level of performance on genome-related biological tasks, these models do\nnot encode biological functions in the presence of sequence variations. To\naddress this problem, we pre-train foundation models that effectively integrate\nsequence variations, in particular Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), as\nthey underlie important biological functions. Specifically, we use ModernBERT\nto pre-train two different Biomedical Foundation Models (BMFM), namely,\nBMFM-DNA-REF in which the model is trained with sequences of varying lengths\nalong with their reverse complements derived from the reference genome and\nBMFM-DNA-SNP in which the model is trained with sequences created using a novel\nrepresentation scheme that encodes sequence variations. Our findings indicate\nthat integrating sequence variations into DNALMs helps capture the biological\nfunctions as seen in improvements on all fine-tuning tasks. To explore the\nmodel's practical utility, we experimented with various strategies for SNP\nimputation on promoter detection task introduced in DNABERT-2. However, we\nacknowledge that the current benchmarks are limited in their ability to fully\nevaluate these models.

Consequently, it is\nhighly dependent on a centralized cluster with fast and reliable interconnects.\nCan we conduct training on slow networks and thereby unleash the power of\ndecentralized clusters when dealing with models exceeding 100 billion\nparameters? In this paper, we propose DiLoCoX, a low-communication large-scale\ndecentralized cluster training framework. It combines Pipeline Parallelism with\nDual Optimizer Policy, One-Step-Delay Overlap of Communication and Local\nTraining, and an Adaptive Gradient Compression Scheme. This combination\nsignificantly improves the scale of parameters and the speed of model\npre-training. We justify the benefits of one-step-delay overlap of\ncommunication and local training, as well as the adaptive gradient compression\nscheme, through a theoretical analysis of convergence. Empirically, we\ndemonstrate that DiLoCoX is capable of pre-training a 107B foundation model\nover a 1Gbps network. Compared to vanilla AllReduce, DiLoCoX can achieve a 357x\nspeedup in distributed training while maintaining negligible degradation in\nmodel convergence.

Thus, there is an urgent need to build a reward bench\ntargeted at agents. To address these challenges, we propose Agent-RewardBench,\na benchmark designed to evaluate reward modeling ability in MLLMs. The\nbenchmark is characterized by three key features: (1) Multiple dimensions and\nreal-world agent scenarios evaluation. It covers perception, planning, and\nsafety with 7 scenarios; (2) Step-level reward evaluation.

While versatile LLMs appear to\nhave demonstrated capabilities in understanding contextual causality and\nproviding responses that obey the laws of causality, it remains unclear whether\nthey perform genuine causal reasoning akin to humans. However, current evidence\nindicates the contrary. Specifically, LLMs are only capable of performing\nshallow (level-1) causal reasoning, primarily attributed to the causal\nknowledge embedded in their parameters, but they lack the capacity for genuine\nhuman-like (level-2) causal reasoning. To support this hypothesis,\nmethodologically, we delve into the autoregression mechanism of\ntransformer-based LLMs, revealing that it is not inherently causal.\nEmpirically, we introduce a new causal Q&A benchmark called CausalProbe-2024,\nwhose corpora are fresh and nearly unseen for the studied LLMs. The LLMs\nexhibit a significant performance drop on CausalProbe-2024 compared to earlier\nbenchmarks, indicating the fact that they primarily engage in level-1 causal\nreasoning.

We propose G^2-Reasoner, a method that\nincorporates general knowledge and goal-oriented prompts into LLMs' causal\nreasoning processes.

Current 3D visual grounding (3DVG) methods treat text instructions with\nmultiple steps as a whole, without extracting useful temporal information from\neach step. However, the instructions in SG3D often contain pronouns such as\n\"it\", \"here\" and \"the same\" to make language expressions concise. This requires\ngrounding methods to understand the context and retrieve relevant information\nfrom previous steps to correctly locate object sequences. Due to the lack of an\neffective module for collecting related historical information,\nstate-of-the-art 3DVG methods face significant challenges in adapting to the\nSG3D task. To fill this gap, we propose GroundFlow -- a plug-in module for\ntemporal reasoning on 3D point cloud sequential grounding. Firstly, we\ndemonstrate that integrating GroundFlow improves the task accuracy of 3DVG\nbaseline methods by a large margin (+7.5\\% and +10.2\\%) in the SG3D benchmark,\neven outperforming a 3D large language model pre-trained on various datasets.\nFurthermore, we selectively extract both short-term and long-term step\ninformation based on its relevance to the current instruction, enabling\nGroundFlow to take a comprehensive view of historical information and maintain\nits temporal understanding advantage as step counts increase. Overall, our work\nintroduces temporal reasoning capabilities to existing 3DVG models and achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in the SG3D benchmark across five datasets.",

    "title": "Task-Aware KV Compression For Cost-Effective Long Video Understanding",
    "summary": "Long-video understanding (LVU) remains a severe challenge for existing\nmultimodal large language models (MLLMs), primarily due to the prohibitive\ncomputational cost. Recent approaches have explored KV compression to mitigate\nthis issue, but they often suffer from significant information loss at high\ncompression ratios. In this paper, we introduce Video-X^2L, which flexibly\npreserves critical video information for each LVU task. Video-X^2L involves two\nkey operations. The first one is called bi-level KV compression. During the\nMLLM's pre-filling stage, Video-X^2L generates two types of compressed KVs:\nlow-compression KVs (L-KVs) to capture fine-grained video details and\nhigh-compression KVs (H-KVs) to offer compact video representations. The second\none is called selective KV re-loading. During the MLLM's decoding stage,\nVideo-X^2L selectively re-loads L-KVs for the most critical video chunks while\nusing H-KVs for other less important ones. This allows the MLLM to fully\nutilize task-specific information while maintaining the overall compactness.\nVideo-X^2L is simple yet effective: it is free from additional training and\ndirectly compatible with existing KV-compressible MLLMs. We evaluate Video-X^2L\nwith a variety of popular LVU benchmarks, including VideoMME, MLVU,\nLongVideoBench, and VNBench. Our experiment result shows that Video-X^2L\noutperforms existing KV-compression methods by a huge advantage while\nsubstantially saving the computation cost.",

    "summary": "The shortage of publicly available, labeled requirements datasets remains a\nmajor barrier to advancing Artificial Intelligence for Requirements Engineering\n(AI4RE). While Large Language Models offer promising capabilities for synthetic\ndata generation, systematic approaches to control and optimize the quality of\ngenerated requirements remain underexplored. This paper presents Synthline v1,\nan enhanced Product Line approach for generating synthetic requirements data\nthat extends our earlier v0 version with advanced generation strategies and\ncuration techniques. We investigate four research questions assessing how\nprompting strategies, automated prompt optimization, and post-generation\ncuration affect data quality across four classification tasks: defect\ndetection, functional vs. non-functional, quality vs. non-quality, and security\nvs. non-security. Our evaluation shows that multi-sample prompting\nsignificantly boosts both utility and diversity over single-sample generation,\nwith F1-score gains from 6 to 44 points. The use of PACE (Prompt Actor-Critic\nEditing) for automated prompt optimization yields task-dependent results,\ngreatly improving functional classification (+32.5 points) but reducing\nperformance on others. Interestingly, similarity-based curation improves\ndiversity but often harms classification performance, indicating that some\nredundancy may help ML models. Most importantly, our results show that\nsynthetic requirements can match or outperform human-authored ones for specific\ntasks, with synthetic data surpassing human data for security (+7.8 points) and\ndefect classification (+15.4 points).

    "title": "Multimodal Prompt Alignment for Facial Expression Recognition",
    "summary": "Prompt learning has been widely adopted to efficiently adapt vision-language\nmodels (VLMs) like CLIP for various downstream tasks. Despite their success,\ncurrent VLM-based facial expression recognition (FER) methods struggle to\ncapture fine-grained textual-visual relationships, which are essential for\ndistinguishing subtle differences between facial expressions. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a multimodal prompt alignment framework for FER, called\nMPA-FER, that provides fine-grained semantic guidance to the learning process\nof prompted visual features, resulting in more precise and interpretable\nrepresentations. Specifically, we introduce a multi-granularity hard prompt\ngeneration strategy that utilizes a large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT to\ngenerate detailed descriptions for each facial expression. The LLM-based\nexternal knowledge is injected into the soft prompts by minimizing the feature\ndiscrepancy between the soft prompts and the hard prompts. To preserve the\ngeneralization abilities of the pretrained CLIP model, our approach\nincorporates prototype-guided visual feature alignment, ensuring that the\nprompted visual features from the frozen image encoder align closely with\nclass-specific prototypes. Additionally, we propose a cross-modal global-local\nalignment module that focuses on expression-relevant facial features, further\nimproving the alignment between textual and visual features. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on\nthree FER benchmark datasets, while retaining the benefits of the pretrained\nmodel and minimizing computational costs.",

    "title": "SAC: A Framework for Measuring and Inducing Personality Traits in LLMs\n  with Dynamic Intensity Control",
    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction across a wide\nrange of fields in recent years. There is also a growing expectation for them\nto display human-like personalities during interactions. To meet this\nexpectation, numerous studies have proposed methods for modelling LLM\npersonalities through psychometric evaluations. However, most existing models\nface two major limitations: they rely on the Big Five (OCEAN) framework, which\nonly provides coarse personality dimensions, and they lack mechanisms for\ncontrolling trait intensity. In this paper, we address this gap by extending\nthe Machine Personality Inventory (MPI), which originally used the Big Five\nmodel, to incorporate the 16 Personality Factor (16PF) model, allowing\nexpressive control over sixteen distinct traits. We also developed a structured\nframework known as Specific Attribute Control (SAC) for evaluating and\ndynamically inducing trait intensity in LLMs. Our method introduces\nadjective-based semantic anchoring to guide trait intensity expression and\nleverages behavioural questions across five intensity factors:\n\\textit{Frequency}, \\textit{Depth}, \\textit{Threshold}, \\textit{Effort}, and\n\\textit{Willingness}. Through experimentation, we find that modelling intensity\nas a continuous spectrum yields substantially more consistent and controllable\npersonality expression compared to binary trait toggling. Moreover, we observe\nthat changes in target trait intensity systematically influence closely related\ntraits in psychologically coherent directions, suggesting that LLMs internalize\nmulti-dimensional personality structures rather than treating traits in\nisolation. Our work opens new pathways for controlled and nuanced human-machine\ninteractions in domains such as healthcare, education, and interviewing\nprocesses, bringing us one step closer to truly human-like social machines.",

    "summary": "Finding balanced ways to employ Large Language Models (LLMs) in education is\na challenge due to inherent risks of poor understanding of the technology and\nof a susceptible audience.

We engage in action research to\ndevelop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game\nstories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it\nemploys open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5\ndifferent LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and\nprompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the\ngeneration successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a\nteacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter\nissues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding\nevaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome\nthese issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs\ndirectly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop\npersonalised narratives on children's preferred topics.

While recent work has explored the use of large language\nmodels (LLMs) for causal inference, most approaches still rely on the\nunconfoundedness assumption. In this paper, we make the first attempt to\nmitigate hidden confounding using LLMs. We propose ProCI (Progressive\nConfounder Imputation), a framework that elicits the semantic and world\nknowledge of LLMs to iteratively generate, impute, and validate hidden\nconfounders.

To improve robustness, ProCI adopts a distributional reasoning\nstrategy instead of direct value imputation to prevent the collapsed outputs.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that ProCI uncovers meaningful confounders\nand significantly improves treatment effect estimation across various datasets\nand LLMs.",

    "summary": "Large language models are trained on massive corpora of web data, which may\ninclude private data, copyrighted material, factually inaccurate data, or data\nthat degrades model performance. Eliminating the influence of such problematic\ndatapoints through complete retraining -- by repeatedly pretraining the model\non datasets that exclude these specific instances -- is computationally\nprohibitive. For this reason, unlearning algorithms have emerged that aim to\neliminate the influence of particular datapoints, while otherwise preserving\nthe model -- at a low computational cost. However, precisely estimating and\nundoing the influence of individual datapoints has proved to be challenging. In\nthis work, we propose a new algorithm, MSA, for estimating and undoing the\ninfluence of datapoints -- by leveraging model checkpoints i.e. artifacts\ncapturing model states at different stages of pretraining. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that MSA consistently outperforms existing machine\nunlearning algorithms across multiple benchmarks, models, and evaluation\nmetrics, suggesting that MSA could be an effective approach towards more\nflexible large language models that are capable of data erasure.",

    "summary": "Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency\nand economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based\nsolvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become\nimpractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,\nrequiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible\nparameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present\na multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously\ninfer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then\ncollaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our\nAutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized\nagents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,\nand optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint\ngeneration using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent\noptimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational\nbounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and\nyield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance\nwith conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational\nefficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in\nunder 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond\ncomputational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates\nsophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,\nand applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant\npotential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly\ncharacterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit\napplications.",

Unlike prior\napproaches that focus on complete verification of the training process\n(incurring significant computational cost) or depend on trusted execution\nenvironments, ZKPROV offers a distinct balance.

Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the\nZKPROV in generating this proof and verifying it, achieving a practical\nsolution for real-world deployments.

The biopsychosocial model recognises pain subjective,\nmultifactorial nature, yet uptake of psychosocial care remains low. We\nhypothesised that patients own pain narratives would predict their readiness to\nengage in psychotherapy.\n  Methods. In a cross-sectional pilot, 24 chronic-pain patients recorded\nnarrated pain stories on Painstory.science. Open questions probed perceived\npain source, interference and influencing factors. Narratives were cleaned,\nembedded with a pretrained large-language model and entered into\nmachine-learning classifiers that output ready/not ready probabilities.\n  Results. The perception-domain model achieved 95.7 % accuracy (specificity =\n0.80, sensitivity = 1.00, AUC = 0.90). The factors-influencing-pain model\nyielded 83.3 % accuracy (specificity = 0.60, sensitivity = 0.90, AUC = 0.75).\nSentence count correlated with readiness for perception narratives (r = 0.54, p\n< .01) and factor narratives (r = 0.24, p < .05).\n  Conclusion.

A key capability for this process is the ability\nto generate novel research ideas, and prior studies have found settings in\nwhich LLM-generated research ideas were judged as more novel than human-expert\nideas. However, a good idea should not simply appear to be novel, it should\nalso result in better research after being executed. To test whether\nAI-generated ideas lead to better research outcomes, we conduct an execution\nstudy by recruiting 43 expert researchers to execute randomly-assigned ideas,\neither written by experts or generated by an LLM. Each expert spent over 100\nhours implementing the idea and wrote a 4-page short paper to document the\nexperiments. All the executed projects are then reviewed blindly by expert NLP\nresearchers. Comparing the review scores of the same ideas before and after\nexecution, the scores of the LLM-generated ideas decrease significantly more\nthan expert-written ideas on all evaluation metrics (novelty, excitement,\neffectiveness, and overall; p < 0.05), closing the gap between LLM and human\nideas observed at the ideation stage. When comparing the aggregated review\nscores from the execution study, we even observe that for many metrics there is\na flip in rankings where human ideas score higher than LLM ideas. This\nideation-execution gap highlights the limitations of current LLMs in generating\ntruly effective research ideas and the challenge of evaluating research ideas\nin the absence of execution outcomes.",

    "summary": "Training large language models is an expensive, compute-bound process that\nmust be repeated as models scale, algorithms improve, and new data is\ncollected. To address this, next-generation hardware accelerators increasingly\nsupport lower-precision arithmetic formats, such as the Microscaling (MX)\nformats introduced in NVIDIA's Blackwell architecture. These formats use a\nshared scale within blocks of parameters to extend representable range and\nperform forward/backward GEMM operations in reduced precision for efficiency\ngains. In this work, we investigate the challenges and viability of\nblock-scaled precision formats during model training. Across nearly one\nthousand language models trained from scratch -- spanning compute budgets from\n$2 \\times 10^{17}$ to $4.8 \\times 10^{19}$ FLOPs and sweeping over a broad\nrange of weight-activation precision combinations -- we consistently observe\nthat training in MX formats exhibits sharp, stochastic instabilities in the\nloss, particularly at larger compute scales. To explain this phenomenon, we\nconduct controlled experiments and ablations on a smaller proxy model that\nexhibits similar behavior as the language model, sweeping across architectural\nsettings, hyperparameters, and precision formats. These experiments motivate a\nsimple model in which multiplicative gradient bias introduced by the\nquantization of layer-norm affine parameters and a small fraction of\nactivations can trigger runaway divergence. Through \\emph{in situ} intervention\nexperiments on our proxy model, we demonstrate that instabilities can be\naverted or delayed by modifying precision schemes mid-training. Guided by these\nfindings, we evaluate stabilization strategies in the LLM setting and show that\ncertain hybrid configurations recover performance competitive with\nfull-precision training.

    "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to\nnavigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other\nagents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning\nskills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason\nabout the \"mental\" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent\nabilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from\nnarrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus\npropose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM\ndrawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in\nall other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other\nbenchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing\ninteractive ToM experiments.\n  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations\nof frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We\nfind that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple\nword-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive\nscience experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities.\nSurprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly\nworse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that\nDecrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and\npaves the path towards better artificial agents.",

To demystify\nthe decoding behavior of dLLMs and unlock their potential for coding, we\nsystematically investigate their denoising processes and reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods. We train a 7B dLLM, \\textbf{DiffuCoder}, on 130B tokens of code.\nUsing this model as a testbed, we analyze its decoding behavior, revealing how\nit differs from that of AR models: (1) dLLMs can decide how causal their\ngeneration should be without relying on semi-AR decoding, and (2) increasing\nthe sampling temperature diversifies not only token choices but also their\ngeneration order. This diversity creates a rich search space for RL rollouts.\nFor RL training, to reduce the variance of token log-likelihood estimates and\nmaintain training efficiency, we propose \\textbf{coupled-GRPO}, a novel\nsampling scheme that constructs complementary mask noise for completions used\nin training.

However, deploying LLM-based agents\nin high-stakes domains comes with significant safety and ethical risks.\nUnethical behavior by these agents can directly result in serious real-world\nconsequences, including physical harm and financial loss. To efficiently steer\nthe ethical behavior of agents, we frame agent behavior steering as a model\nediting task, which we term Behavior Editing. Model editing is an emerging area\nof research that enables precise and efficient modifications to LLMs while\npreserving their overall capabilities. To systematically study and evaluate\nthis approach, we introduce BehaviorBench, a multi-tier benchmark grounded in\npsychological moral theories. This benchmark supports both the evaluation and\nediting of agent behaviors across a variety of scenarios, with each tier\nintroducing more complex and ambiguous scenarios. We first demonstrate that\nBehavior Editing can dynamically steer agents toward the target behavior within\nspecific scenarios. Moreover, Behavior Editing enables not only\nscenario-specific local adjustments but also more extensive shifts in an\nagent's global moral alignment. We demonstrate that Behavior Editing can be\nused to promote ethical and benevolent behavior or, conversely, to induce\nharmful or malicious behavior. Through comprehensive evaluations on agents\nbased on frontier LLMs, BehaviorBench shows the effectiveness of Behavior\nEditing across different models and scenarios.

Automating this process could greatly benefit fields such as\narchitectural design, robotics simulation, virtual reality, and gaming. Recent\napproaches to 3D scene synthesis often rely on the commonsense reasoning of\nlarge language models (LLMs) or strong visual priors of modern image generation\nmodels. However, current LLMs demonstrate limited 3D spatial reasoning ability,\nwhich restricts their ability to generate realistic and coherent 3D scenes.\nMeanwhile, image generation-based methods often suffer from constraints in\nviewpoint selection and multi-view inconsistencies. In this work, we present\nVideo Perception models for 3D Scene synthesis (VIPScene), a novel framework\nthat exploits the encoded commonsense knowledge of the 3D physical world in\nvideo generation models to ensure coherent scene layouts and consistent object\nplacements across views. VIPScene accepts both text and image prompts and\nseamlessly integrates video generation, feedforward 3D reconstruction, and\nopen-vocabulary perception models to semantically and geometrically analyze\neach object in a scene. This enables flexible scene synthesis with high realism\nand structural consistency. For more precise analysis, we further introduce\nFirst-Person View Score (FPVScore) for coherence and plausibility evaluation,\nutilizing continuous first-person perspective to capitalize on the reasoning\nability of multimodal large language models.

In contrast, we are most\ninterested in techniques that generalize across open-ended tasks, formally\nverifiable tasks, and across languages. In this work, we study how to robustly\nscale inference-time compute for open-ended generative tasks in a multilingual,\nmulti-task setting.\n  Our findings show that both sampling strategy based on temperature variation\nand selection strategy must be adapted to account for diverse domains and\nvaried language settings.

In particular, our combined sampling and\nselection methods lead to an average +6.8 jump in win-rates for our 8B models\non m-ArenaHard-v2.0 prompts, against proprietary models such as Gemini.

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language\nmodels (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and\ndata efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal\nperformance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms\nbetween off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple\noff-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with\n$r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$\nemphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more\nheavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE\nalgorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward,\nthe algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that\nwhile on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals,\noff-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on\nnegative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled\nstochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on\nreasoning tasks.",

We show that CoDoT\nresults in a consistent failure of a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs. For\nexample, GPT-4 Turbo's toxicity increases 16.5 times, DeepSeek R1 fails 100% of\nthe time, and toxicity increases 300% on average across seven modern LLMs.\nAdditionally, recursively applying CoDoT can further increase toxicity two\ntimes.

Furthermore,\nsequential data processing with Transformers encounters a fundamental barrier:\nquadratic complexity growth with sequence length. Motivated by these\nlimitations, our ambition is to create more efficient models that are less\nreliant on intensive computations and massive volumes of data. We introduce\nEcho State Transformers (EST), a hybrid architecture that elegantly resolves\nthis challenge while demonstrating exceptional performance in low-data regimes.\nEST integrates the Transformer attention mechanisms with principles from\nReservoir Computing to create a fixedsize window distributed memory system.\nDrawing inspiration from Echo State Networks, the most prominent instance of\nthe Reservoir Computing paradigm, our architecture integrates a new module\ncalled ''Working Memory'' based on several reservoirs (i.e. random recurrent\nnetworks) working in parallel. These reservoirs work as independent memory\nunits with distinct internal dynamics. A novelty here is that the classical\nreservoir hyperparameters controlling the dynamics are now trained. Thus, the\nEST dynamically adapts the memory/non-linearity trade-off in reservoirs. By\nmaintaining a fixed number of memory units regardless of sequence length, EST\nachieves constant computational complexity at each processing step, effectively\nbreaking the quadratic scaling problem of standard Transformers. Evaluations on\nthe STREAM benchmark, which comprises 12 diverse sequential processing tasks,\ndemonstrate that EST outperforms GRUs, LSTMs, and even Transformers on 8 of\nthese tasks. These findings highlight that Echo State Transformers can be an\neffective replacement to GRUs and LSTMs while complementing standard\nTransformers at least on resource-constrained environments and low-data\nscenarios across diverse sequential processing tasks.",

Existing systems typically identify\nimportant tokens and selectively offload their KV data to GPU and CPU memory.\nThe KV data needs to be offloaded to disk due to the limited memory on a\ncommodity GPU, but the process is bottlenecked by token importance evaluation\noverhead and the disk's low bandwidth. In this paper, we present LeoAM, the\nfirst efficient importance-aware long-context LLM inference system for a single\ncommodity GPU with adaptive hierarchical GPU-CPU-Disk KV management. Our system\nemploys an adaptive KV management strategy that partitions KV data into\nvariable-sized chunks based on the skewed distribution of attention weights\nacross different layers to reduce computational and additional transmission\noverheads. Moreover, we propose a lightweight KV abstract method, which\nminimizes transmission latency by storing and extracting the KV abstract of\neach chunk on disk instead of the full KV data. LeoAM also leverages the\ndynamic compression and pipeline techniques to further accelerate inference.\nExperimental results demonstrate that LongInfer achieves an average inference\nlatency speedup of 3.46x, while maintaining comparable LLM response quality. In\nscenarios with larger batch sizes, it achieves up to a 5.47x speedup.",

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show\npromise for automated operating room (OR) risk detection, they often exhibit\nvisual-semantic knowledge conflicts (VS-KC), failing to identify visual safety\nviolations despite understanding textual rules. To address this, we introduce a\ndataset comprising over 34,000 synthetic images generated by diffusion models,\ndepicting operating room scenes containing entities that violate established\nsafety rules.

    "summary": "Recent advancements in multimodal large language models have enhanced\ndocument understanding by integrating textual and visual information. However,\nexisting models exhibit incompleteness within their paradigm in real-world\nscenarios, particularly under visual degradation. In such conditions, the\ncurrent response paradigm often fails to adequately perceive visual degradation\nand ambiguity, leading to overreliance on linguistic priors or misaligned\nvisual-textual reasoning. This difficulty in recognizing uncertainty frequently\nresults in the generation of hallucinatory content, especially when a precise\nanswer is not feasible. To better demonstrate and analyze this phenomenon and\nproblem, we propose KIE-HVQA, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating OCR\nhallucination in degraded document understanding. This dataset includes test\nsamples spanning identity cards and invoices, with simulated real-world\ndegradations for OCR reliability. This setup allows for evaluating models'\ncapacity, under degraded input, to distinguish reliable visual information and\nanswer accordingly, thereby highlighting the challenge of avoiding\nhallucination on uncertain data. To achieve vision-faithful reasoning and\nthereby avoid the aforementioned issues, we further introduce a GRPO-based\nframework featuring a novel reward mechanism. By incorporating a self-awareness\nof visual uncertainty and an analysis method that initiates refusal to answer\nto increase task difficulty within our supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement\nlearning framework, we successfully mitigated hallucinations in ambiguous\nregions. Experiments on Qwen2.5-VL demonstrate that our 7B-parameter model\nachieves a 22\\% absolute improvement in hallucination-free accuracy over GPT-4o\non KIE-HVQA and there is no significant performance drop in standard tasks,\nhighlighting both effectiveness and robustness.",

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit systematic risk-taking behaviors\nanalogous to those observed in gambling psychology, including overconfidence\nbias, loss-chasing tendencies, and probability misjudgment. Drawing from\nbehavioral economics and prospect theory, we identify and formalize these\n\"gambling-like\" patterns where models sacrifice accuracy for high-reward\noutputs, exhibit escalating risk-taking after errors, and systematically\nmiscalibrate uncertainty. We propose the Risk-Aware Response Generation (RARG)\nframework, incorporating insights from gambling research to address these\nbehavioral biases through risk-calibrated training, loss-aversion mechanisms,\nand uncertainty-aware decision making. Our approach introduces novel evaluation\nparadigms based on established gambling psychology experiments, including AI\nadaptations of the Iowa Gambling Task and probability learning assessments.\nExperimental results demonstrate measurable reductions in gambling-like\nbehaviors: 18.7\\% decrease in overconfidence bias, 24.3\\% reduction in\nloss-chasing tendencies, and improved risk calibration across diverse\nscenarios. This work establishes the first systematic framework for\nunderstanding and mitigating gambling psychology patterns in AI systems.",

However, the research community currently lacks a\ncomprehensive benchmark specifically designed for artifact localization in AI\ngenerated videos. Existing datasets either restrict themselves to video or\nframe level detection or lack the fine-grained spatial annotations necessary\nfor evaluating localization methods. To address this gap, we introduce\nBrokenVideos, a benchmark dataset of 3,254 AI-generated videos with\nmeticulously annotated, pixel-level masks highlighting regions of visual\ncorruption. Each annotation is validated through detailed human inspection to\nensure high quality ground truth. Our experiments show that training state of\nthe art artifact detection models and multi modal large language models (MLLMs)\non BrokenVideos significantly improves their ability to localize corrupted\nregions. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that BrokenVideos\nestablishes a critical foundation for benchmarking and advancing research on\nartifact localization in generative video models.

In this work, we introduce STReason, a novel framework that\nintegrates the reasoning strengths of large language models (LLMs) with the\nanalytical capabilities of spatio-temporal models for multi-task inference and\nexecution. Without requiring task-specific finetuning, STReason leverages\nin-context learning to decompose complex natural language queries into modular,\ninterpretable programs, which are then systematically executed to generate both\nsolutions and detailed rationales. To facilitate rigorous evaluation, we\nconstruct a new benchmark dataset and propose a unified evaluation framework\nwith metrics specifically designed for long-form spatio-temporal reasoning.\nExperimental results show that STReason significantly outperforms advanced LLM\nbaselines across all metrics, particularly excelling in complex,\nreasoning-intensive spatio-temporal scenarios.

We propose \"FemmIR\", a framework to retrieve\nmultimodal results relevant to information needs expressed with multimodal\nqueries by example without any similarity label. Such identification is\nnecessary for real-world applications where data annotations are scarce and\nsatisfactory performance is required without fine-tuning with a common\nframework across applications. We curate a new dataset called MuQNOL for\nbenchmarking progress on this task. Our technique is based on weak supervision\nintroduced through edit distance between samples: graph edit distance can be\nmodified to consider the cost of replacing a data sample in terms of its\nproperties, and relevance can be measured through the implicit signal from the\namount of edit cost among the objects. Unlike metric learning or encoding\nnetworks, FemmIR re-uses the high-level properties and maintains the property\nvalue and relationship constraints with a multi-level interaction score between\ndata samples and the query example provided by the user.

This\nmotivated reasoning at a collective level can be detrimental to society when\ndebating critical issues such as human-driven climate change or vaccine safety,\nand can further aggravate political polarization. Prior studies have reported\nthat large language models (LLMs) are also susceptible to human-like cognitive\nbiases, however, the extent to which LLMs selectively reason toward\nidentity-congruent conclusions remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate\nwhether assigning 8 personas across 4 political and socio-demographic\nattributes induces motivated reasoning in LLMs. Testing 8 LLMs (open source and\nproprietary) across two reasoning tasks from human-subject studies -- veracity\ndiscernment of misinformation headlines and evaluation of numeric scientific\nevidence -- we find that persona-assigned LLMs have up to 9% reduced veracity\ndiscernment relative to models without personas.

    "summary": "Background The increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in\nhealthcare has sparked growing concerns about its environmental and ethical\nimplications. Commercial Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and\nDeepSeek, require substantial resources, while the utilization of these systems\nfor medical purposes raises critical issues regarding patient privacy and\nsafety. Methods We developed a customizable Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) framework for medical tasks, which monitors its energy usage and CO2\nemissions. This system was then used to create RAGs based on various\nopen-source LLMs. The tested models included both general purpose models like\nllama3.1:8b and medgemma-4b-it, which is medical-domain specific. The best RAGs\nperformance and energy consumption was compared to DeepSeekV3-R1 and OpenAIs\no4-mini model. A dataset of medical questions was used for the evaluation.\nResults Custom RAG models outperformed commercial models in accuracy and energy\nconsumption. The RAG model built on llama3.1:8B achieved the highest accuracy\n(58.5%) and was significantly better than other models, including o4-mini and\nDeepSeekV3-R1. The llama3.1-RAG also exhibited the lowest energy consumption\nand CO2 footprint among all models, with a Performance per kWh of 0.52 and a\ntotal CO2 emission of 473g. Compared to o4-mini, the llama3.1-RAG achieved 2.7x\ntimes more accuracy points per kWh and 172% less electricity usage while\nmaintaining higher accuracy. Conclusion Our study demonstrates that local LLMs\ncan be leveraged to develop RAGs that outperform commercial, online LLMs in\nmedical tasks, while having a smaller environmental impact. Our modular\nframework promotes sustainable AI development, reducing electricity usage and\naligning with the UNs Sustainable Development Goals.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) predominantly use autoregressive (AR)\napproaches, but masked diffusion models (MDMs) are emerging as viable\nalternatives. A key challenge in comparing AR and MDM paradigms is their\ntypical architectural difference: AR models are often decoder-only, while MDMs\nhave largely been encoder-only. This practice of changing both the modeling\nparadigm and architecture simultaneously makes direct comparisons unfair, as\nit's hard to distinguish whether observed differences stem from the paradigm\nitself or the architectural shift. This research evaluates MDMs within a\ndecoder-only framework to: (1) equitably compare MDM (as Any-Order AR, or\nAO-AR) and standard AR paradigms. Our investigation suggests that the standard\nAO-AR objective, which averages over all token permutations, may benefit from\nrefinement, as many permutations appear less informative compared to the\nlanguage's inherent left-to-right structure. (2) Investigate architectural\ninfluences (decoder-only vs. encoder-only) within MDMs. We demonstrate that\nwhile encoder-only MDMs model a simpler conditional probability space,\ndecoder-only MDMs can achieve dramatic generation speedups ($\\sim25\\times$) and\ncomparable perplexity with temperature annealing despite modeling a vastly\nlarger space, highlighting key trade-offs. This work thus decouples core\nparadigm differences from architectural influences, offering insights for\nfuture model design. Code is available at https://github.com/scxue/AO-GPT-MDM.",

Despite their success,\ncurrent unified multimodal medical LLMs face limitations in knowledge update\ncosts, comprehensiveness, and flexibility. To address these challenges, we\nintroduce the Modular Multi-Agent Framework for Multi-Modal Medical Diagnosis\n(MAM). Inspired by our empirical findings highlighting the benefits of role\nassignment and diagnostic discernment in LLMs, MAM decomposes the medical\ndiagnostic process into specialized roles: a General Practitioner, Specialist\nTeam, Radiologist, Medical Assistant, and Director, each embodied by an\nLLM-based agent. This modular and collaborative framework enables efficient\nknowledge updates and leverages existing medical LLMs and knowledge bases.\nExtensive experimental evaluations conducted on a wide range of publicly\naccessible multimodal medical datasets, incorporating text, image, audio, and\nvideo modalities, demonstrate that MAM consistently surpasses the performance\nof modality-specific LLMs. Notably, MAM achieves significant performance\nimprovements ranging from 18% to 365% compared to baseline models.

    "summary": "Art curatorship has always been mostly the subjective work of human experts,\nwho, with extensive knowledge of many and diverse artworks, select a few of\nthose to present in communal spaces, spaces that evolved into what we now call\nart galleries. There are no hard and fast set of rules on how to select these\nartworks, given a theme which either is presented to the art curator or\nconstructed by her/him. Here we present a series of artificial models -- a\ntotal of four related models -- based on machine learning techniques (a subset\nof artificial intelligence) that attempt to learn from existing exhibitions\nwhich have been curated by human experts, in order to be able to do similar\ncuratorship work. We focus exclusively on the last 25 years of past exhibitions\nat the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, due to the quality of the data\navailable and the physical and time limitations of our research. Our four\nartificial intelligence models achieve a reasonable ability at imitating these\nvarious curators responsible for all those exhibitions, with various degrees of\nprecision and curatorial coherence. In particular, we can conclude two key\ninsights: first, that there is sufficient information in these exhibitions to\nconstruct an artificial intelligence model that replicates past exhibitions\nwith an accuracy well above random choices; second, that using feature\nengineering and carefully designing the architecture of modest size models can\nmake them as good as those using the so-called large language models such as\nGPT in a brute force approach. We also believe, based on small attempts to use\nthe models in out-of-sample experiments, that given more much more data, it\nshould be possible for these kinds of artificial intelligence agents to be\ncloser and closer to the aesthetic and curatorial judgment of human art\ncurators.",

To address\nthe high hallucination in slow-thinking models, we propose Knowledge-enhanced\nRL, KnowRL.

KnowRL\nguides models to perform fact-based slow thinking by integrating a factuality\nreward, based on knowledge verification, into the RL training process, helping\nthem recognize their knowledge boundaries. This targeted factual input during\nRL training enables the model to learn and internalize fact-based reasoning\nstrategies. By directly rewarding adherence to facts within the reasoning\nsteps, KnowRL fosters a more reliable thinking process.

While LLMs offer promising capabilities for modeling\nhuman-like agents compared to traditional agent-based modeling, they face\nfundamental limitations that constrain their reliability for social pattern\ndiscovery. The core issue lies in LLMs' tendency towards an ``average persona''\nthat lacks sufficient behavioral heterogeneity, a critical requirement for\nsimulating complex social dynamics. We examine three key boundary problems:\nalignment (simulated behaviors matching real-world patterns), consistency\n(maintaining coherent agent behavior over time), and robustness\n(reproducibility under varying conditions). We propose heuristic boundaries for\ndetermining when LLM-based simulations can reliably advance social science\nunderstanding. We believe that these simulations are more valuable when\nfocusing on (1) collective patterns rather than individual trajectories, (2)\nagent behaviors aligning with real population averages despite limited\nvariance, and (3) proper validation methods available for testing simulation\nrobustness. We provide a practical checklist to guide researchers in\ndetermining the appropriate scope and claims for LLM-based social simulations.",

    "summary": "Despite extensive research on Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion\nDetection Systems (ML-NIDS), their capability to detect diverse attack variants\nremains uncertain. Prior studies have largely relied on homogeneous datasets,\nwhich artificially inflate performance scores and offer a false sense of\nsecurity. Designing systems that can effectively detect a wide range of attack\nvariants remains a significant challenge. The progress of ML-NIDS continues to\ndepend heavily on human expertise, which can embed subjective judgments of\nsystem designers into the model, potentially hindering its ability to\ngeneralize across diverse attack types.\n  To address this gap, we propose KnowML, a framework for knowledge-guided\nmachine learning that integrates attack knowledge into ML-NIDS. KnowML\nsystematically explores the threat landscape by leveraging Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to perform automated analysis of attack implementations. It\nconstructs a unified Knowledge Graph (KG) of attack strategies, on which it\napplies symbolic reasoning to generate KG-Augmented Input, embedding domain\nknowledge directly into the design process of ML-NIDS.\n  We evaluate KnowML on 28 realistic attack variants, of which 10 are newly\ncollected for this study. Our findings reveal that baseline ML-NIDS models fail\nto detect several variants entirely, achieving F1 scores as low as 0 %. In\ncontrast, our knowledge-guided approach achieves up to 99 % F1 score while\nmaintaining a False Positive Rate below 0.1 %.",

PromptAug achieves statistically\nsignificant improvements of 2% in both accuracy and F1-score on conflict and\nemotion datasets. To thoroughly evaluate PromptAug against other data\naugmentation methods we conduct a robust evaluation using extreme data scarcity\nscenarios, quantitative diversity analysis and a qualitative thematic analysis.\nThe thematic analysis identifies four problematic patterns in augmented text:\nLinguistic Fluidity, Humour Ambiguity, Augmented Content Ambiguity, and\nAugmented Content Misinterpretation.\n  Overall, this work presents PromptAug as an effective method for augmenting\ndata in sensitive tasks like conflict detection, offering a unique,\ninterdisciplinary evaluation grounded in both natural language processing and\nsocial science methodology.",

    "summary": "Medical document analysis plays a crucial role in extracting essential\nclinical insights from unstructured healthcare records, supporting critical\ntasks such as differential diagnosis. Determining the most probable condition\namong overlapping symptoms requires precise evaluation and deep medical\nexpertise. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have\nsignificantly enhanced performance in medical document analysis, privacy\nconcerns related to sensitive patient data limit the use of online LLMs\nservices in clinical settings. To address these challenges, we propose a\ntrustworthy medical document analysis platform that fine-tunes a LLaMA-v3 using\nlow-rank adaptation, specifically optimized for differential diagnosis tasks.\nOur approach utilizes DDXPlus, the largest benchmark dataset for differential\ndiagnosis, and demonstrates superior performance in pathology prediction and\nvariable-length differential diagnosis compared to existing methods. The\ndeveloped web-based platform allows users to submit their own unstructured\nmedical documents and receive accurate, explainable diagnostic results. By\nincorporating advanced explainability techniques, the system ensures\ntransparent and reliable predictions, fostering user trust and confidence.\nExtensive evaluations confirm that the proposed method surpasses current\nstate-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy while offering practical utility\nin clinical settings.

    "summary": "Extreme activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) critically\ndegrade quantization performance, hindering efficient on-device deployment.\nWhile channel-wise operations and adaptive gradient scaling are recognized\ncauses, practical mitigation remains challenging. We introduce Outlier-Safe\nPre-Training (OSP), a practical guideline that proactively prevents outlier\nformation rather than relying on post-hoc mitigation. OSP combines three key\ninnovations: (1) the Muon optimizer, eliminating privileged bases while\nmaintaining training efficiency; (2) Single-Scale RMSNorm, preventing\nchannel-wise amplification; and (3) a learnable embedding projection,\nredistributing activation magnitudes originating from embedding matrices. We\nvalidate OSP by training a 1.4B-parameter model on 1 trillion tokens, which is\nthe first production-scale LLM trained without such outliers. Under aggressive\n4-bit quantization, our OSP model achieves a 35.7 average score across 10\nbenchmarks (compared to 26.5 for an Adam-trained model), with only a 2%\ntraining overhead. Remarkably, OSP models exhibit near-zero excess kurtosis\n(0.04) compared to extreme values (1818.56) in standard models, fundamentally\naltering LLM quantization behavior. Our work demonstrates that outliers are not\ninherent to LLMs but are consequences of training strategies, paving the way\nfor more efficient LLM deployment.

Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs)\nhave been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated\nto clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the\nincreasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning\nguidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet\nbeen explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for\nultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for\nultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a\ntransformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object\ndetection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user\nquery is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through\nLLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding\nultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view,\nassisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical\nexploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning\nguidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions,\nincluding the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers.

Nowadays, agents are undergoing a new round of evolution.\nThey no longer act as an isolated island like LLMs. Instead, they start to\ncommunicate with diverse external entities, such as other agents and tools, to\nperform more complex tasks collectively. Under this trend, agent communication\nis regarded as a foundational pillar of the future AI ecosystem, and many\norganizations have intensively begun to design related communication protocols\n(e.g., Anthropic's MCP and Google's A2A) within the recent few months. However,\nthis new field exposes significant security hazards, which can cause severe\ndamage to real-world scenarios. To help researchers quickly figure out this\npromising topic and benefit the future agent communication development, this\npaper presents a comprehensive survey of agent communication security. More\nprecisely, we first present a clear definition of agent communication and\ncategorize the entire lifecycle of agent communication into three stages:\nuser-agent interaction, agent-agent communication, and agent-environment\ncommunication. Next, for each communication phase, we dissect related protocols\nand analyze the security risks according to the communication characteristics.\nThen, we summarize and outlook on the possible defense countermeasures for each\nrisk. In addition, we conduct experiments using MCP and A2A to help readers\nbetter understand the novel vulnerabilities brought by agent communication.\nFinally, we discuss open issues and future directions in this promising\nresearch field.",

    "summary": "Temporal Knowledge Graph Alignment (TKGA) seeks to identify equivalent\nentities across heterogeneous temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) for fusion to\nimprove their completeness. Although some approaches have been proposed to\ntackle this task, most assume unified temporal element standards and simplified\ntemporal structures across different TKGs. They cannot deal with TKGA in the\nwild (TKGA-Wild), where multi-scale temporal element entanglement and\ncross-source temporal structural imbalances are common. To bridge this gap, we\nstudy the task of TKGA-Wild and propose HyDRA, a new and effective solution.\nHyDRA is the first to reformulate the task via multi-scale hypergraph\nretrieval-augmented generation to address the challenges of TKGA-Wild.In\naddition, we design a new scale-weave synergy mechanism for HyDRA, which\nincorporates intra-scale interactions and cross-scale conflict detection. This\nmechanism is designed to alleviate the fragmentation caused by multi-source\ntemporal incompleteness and resolves inconsistencies arising from complex and\nuneven temporal event density distributions, thereby enhancing the model\ncapacity to handle the intricacies of real-world temporal alignment. Finally,\nthere is no standard benchmark that captures these challenges of TKGA-Wild and\neffectively evaluates existing methods. To this end, we formally propose to\nbenchmark challenges for TKGA-Wild and validate the effectiveness of the method\nby establishing two new datasets(BETA and WildBETA). Extensive experiments on\nthe new datasets and six representative benchmarks show that BETA and WildBETA\nbetter reflect real-world challenges. Meanwhile, HyDRA proposes a new paradigm\nfor TKGA-Wild, consistently outperforming 24 competitive baselines, while\nmaintaining strong efficiency and scalability.",

However,\nexisting approaches rely heavily on manual annotation or predefined\nrelationship taxonomies. We propose EDR-MQ (Extracting Document Relations by\nMarginalizing over User Queries), a novel framework that discovers document\nrelationships through query marginalization. EDR-MQ is based on the insight\nthat strongly related documents often co-occur in results across diverse user\nqueries, enabling us to estimate joint probabilities between document pairs by\nmarginalizing over a collection of queries. To enable this query\nmarginalization approach, we develop Multiply Conditioned Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (MC-RAG), which employs conditional retrieval where subsequent\ndocument retrievals depend on previously retrieved content. By observing\nco-occurrence patterns across diverse queries, EDR-MQ estimates joint\nprobabilities between document pairs without requiring labeled training data or\npredefined taxonomies. Experimental results show that our query marginalization\napproach successfully identifies meaningful document relationships, revealing\ntopical clusters, evidence chains, and cross-domain connections that are not\napparent through traditional similarity-based methods.

Existing WMs primarily focus on unstructured data and\ncannot leverage the ubiquitous structured data, often represented as graphs, in\nthe digital world. While multiple graph foundation models have been proposed,\nthey focus on graph learning tasks and cannot extend to diverse multi-modal\ndata and interdisciplinary tasks. To address these challenges, we propose the\nGraph World Model (GWM), a world model that supports both unstructured and\ngraph-structured states with multi-modal information and represents diverse\ntasks as actions. The core of a GWM is a generic message-passing algorithm to\naggregate structured information, either over a unified multi-modal token space\nby converting multi-modal data into text (GWM-T) or a unified multi-modal\nembedding space by modality-specific encoders (GWM-E).

Extensive experiments on\nsix tasks from diverse domains, including multi-modal generation and matching,\nrecommendation, graph prediction, multi-agent, retrieval-augmented generation,\nand planning and optimization, show that the same GWM outperforms or matches\ndomain-specific baselines' performance, benefits from multi-hop structures, and\ndemonstrates strong zero-shot/few-shot capabilities on unseen new tasks.

We\npresent HedraRAG, a runtime system built on a graph-based abstraction that\nexposes optimization opportunities across stage-level parallelism,\nintra-request similarity, and inter-request skewness. These opportunities are\nrealized through dynamic graph transformations, such as node splitting,\nreordering, edge addition, and dependency rewiring, applied to wavefronts of\nsubgraphs spanning concurrent requests. The resulting execution plans are\nmapped onto hybrid CPU-GPU pipelines to improve resource utilization and reduce\nlatency. Evaluations across a wide range of RAG workflows demonstrate speedups\nexceeding 1.5x and reaching up to 5x over existing frameworks, showcasing the\neffectiveness of coordinated generation and retrieval in serving environments.",

Our system\ncomprises two main agents: Truth Sleuth and Trend Bender.\n  Truth Sleuth extracts claims from a YouTube video, uses a Retrieval-Augmented\nGeneration (RAG) approach - drawing on sources like Wikipedia, Google Search,\nGoogle FactCheck - to accurately assess their veracity and generates a nuanced\nand comprehensive report. Through rigorous prompt engineering, Trend Bender\nleverages this report along with a curated corpus of relevant articles to\ngenerate insightful and persuasive comments designed to stimulate a productive\ndebate. With a carefully set up self-evaluation loop, this agent is able to\niteratively improve its style and refine its output.\n  We demonstrate the system's capabilities through experiments on established\nbenchmark datasets and a real-world deployment on YouTube, showcasing its\npotential to engage users and potentially influence perspectives.

    "summary": "Cross-lingual retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a critical capability\nfor retrieving and generating answers across languages. Prior work in this\ncontext has mostly focused on generation and relied on benchmarks derived from\nopen-domain sources, most notably Wikipedia. In such settings, retrieval\nchallenges often remain hidden due to language imbalances, overlap with\npretraining data, and memorized content. To address this gap, we study\nArabic-English RAG in a domain-specific setting using benchmarks derived from\nreal-world corporate datasets. Our benchmarks include all combinations of\nlanguages for the user query and the supporting document, drawn independently\nand uniformly at random. This enables a systematic study of multilingual\nretrieval behavior.\n  Our findings reveal that retrieval is a critical bottleneck in cross-lingual\ndomain-specific scenarios, with significant performance drops occurring when\nthe user query and supporting document languages differ. A key insight is that\nthese failures stem primarily from the retriever's difficulty in ranking\ndocuments across languages. Finally, we propose a simple retrieval strategy\nthat addresses this source of failure by enforcing equal retrieval from both\nlanguages, resulting in substantial improvements in cross-lingual and overall\nperformance. These results highlight meaningful opportunities for improving\nmultilingual retrieval, particularly in practical, real-world RAG applications.",

Applied to apple leaf disease diagnosis, we benchmark three\nconfigurations: (I) zero-shot with confidence-based orchestration, (II)\nfine-tuned agents with improved performance, and (III) trust-calibrated\norchestration enhanced by CLIP-based image retrieval and re-evaluation loops.\nUsing confidence calibration metrics (ECE, OCR, CCC), the orchestrator\nmodulates trust across agents. Our results demonstrate a 77.94\\% accuracy\nimprovement in the zero-shot setting using trust-aware orchestration and RAG,\nachieving 85.63\\% overall.

    "summary": "The detection of sequential patterns in data is a basic functionality of\nmodern data processing systems for complex event processing (CEP), OLAP, and\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG). In practice, pattern matching is\nchallenging, since common applications rely on a large set of patterns that\nshall be evaluated with tight latency bounds. At the same time, matching needs\nto maintain state, i.e., intermediate results, that grows exponentially in the\ninput size. Hence, systems turn to best-effort processing, striving for maximal\nrecall under a latency bound. Existing techniques, however, consider each\npattern in isolation, neglecting the optimization potential induced by state\nsharing in pattern matching.\n  In this paper, we present SHARP, a library that employs state reduction to\nachieve efficient best-effort pattern matching. To this end, SHARP incorporates\nstate sharing between patterns through a new abstraction, coined\npattern-sharing degree (PSD). At runtime, this abstraction facilitates the\ncategorization and indexing of partial pattern matches. Based thereon, once a\nlatency bound is exceeded, SHARP realizes best-effort processing by selecting a\nsubset of partial matches for further processing in constant time. In\nexperiments with real-world data, SHARP achieves a recall of 97%, 96% and 73%\nfor pattern matching in CEP, OLAP, and RAG applications, under a bound of 50%\nof the average processing latency.",

In this paper, we introduce UrbanMind, a tool-enhanced\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework designed to facilitate UGI.\nCentral to UrbanMind is a novel architecture based on Continual\nRetrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLM (C-RAG-LLM), which dynamically incorporates\ndomain-specific knowledge and evolving urban data to support long-term\nadaptability. The architecture of C-RAG-LLM aligns naturally with a multilevel\noptimization framework, where different layers are treated as interdependent\nsub-problems. Each layer has distinct objectives and can be optimized either\nindependently or jointly through a hierarchical learning process. The framework\nis highly flexible, supporting both end-to-end training and partial layer-wise\noptimization based on resource or deployment constraints. To remain adaptive\nunder data drift, it is further integrated with an incremental corpus updating\nmechanism.

    "summary": "Multimodal embedding models have been crucial in enabling various downstream\ntasks such as semantic similarity, information retrieval, and clustering over\ndifferent modalities. However, existing multimodal embeddings like VLM2Vec,\nE5-V, GME are predominantly focused on natural images, with limited support for\nother visual forms such as videos and visual documents. This restricts their\napplicability in real-world scenarios, including AI agents, multi-modal search\nand recommendation, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To close this\ngap, we propose VLM2Vec-V2, a unified framework for learning embeddings across\ndiverse visual forms. First, we introduce MMEB-V2, a comprehensive benchmark\nthat extends MMEB with five new task types: visual document retrieval, video\nretrieval, temporal grounding, video classification and video question\nanswering - spanning text, image, video, and visual document inputs. Next, we\ntrain VLM2Vec-V2, a general-purpose embedding model that supports text, image,\nvideo, and visual document inputs. Extensive experiments show that VLM2Vec-V2\nachieves strong performance not only on the newly introduced video and document\nretrieval tasks, but also improves over prior baselines on the original image\nbenchmarks. Through extensive evaluation, our study offers insights into the\ngeneralizability of various multimodal embedding models and highlights\neffective strategies for unified embedding learning, laying the groundwork for\nmore scalable and adaptable representation learning in both research and\nreal-world settings.",

While classical machine learning\nmodels leverage structured socio-demographic and behavioral data, they often\nfail to capture the nuanced emotional and contextual factors embedded in\nunstructured student interactions.

A cross-modal attention layer then fuses these insights with\ntemporal engagement patterns, creating holistic risk pro-files.

    "summary": "Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has primarily been studied in limited\nsettings, such as factoid question answering; more challenging,\nreasoning-intensive benchmarks have seen limited success from minimal RAG. In\nthis work, we challenge this prevailing view on established,\nreasoning-intensive benchmarks: MMLU, MMLU Pro, AGI Eval, GPQA, and MATH. We\nidentify a key missing component in prior work: a usable, web-scale datastore\naligned with the breadth of pretraining data. To this end, we introduce\nCompactDS: a diverse, high-quality, web-scale datastore that achieves high\nretrieval accuracy and subsecond latency on a single-node. The key insights are\n(1) most web content can be filtered out without sacrificing coverage, and a\ncompact, high-quality subset is sufficient; and (2) combining in-memory\napproximate nearest neighbor (ANN) retrieval and on-disk exact search balances\nspeed and recall. Using CompactDS, we show that a minimal RAG pipeline achieves\nconsistent accuracy improvements across all benchmarks and model sizes\n(8B--70B), with relative gains of 10% on MMLU, 33% on MMLU Pro, 14% on GPQA,\nand 19% on MATH. No single data source suffices alone, highlighting the\nimportance of diversity of sources (web crawls, curated math, academic papers,\ntextbooks). Finally, we show that our carefully designed in-house datastore\nmatches or outperforms web search engines such as Google Search, as well as\nrecently proposed, complex agent-based RAG systems--all while maintaining\nsimplicity, reproducibility, and self-containment. We release CompactDS and our\nretrieval pipeline, supporting future research exploring retrieval-based AI\nsystems.",

    "title": "Education-Oriented Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Learning\n  Path Recommendation",
    "summary": "Learning path recommendation seeks to provide learners with a structured\nsequence of learning items (e.g., knowledge concepts or exercises) to optimize\ntheir learning efficiency. Despite significant efforts in this area, most\nexisting methods primarily rely on prerequisite relationships, which present\ntwo major limitations: 1) Many educational datasets do not explicitly provide\nprerequisite relationships between knowledge concepts, hindering the\napplication of current learning path recommendation methods. 2) Relying solely\non prerequisite relationships as the sole knowledge structure can impede\nlearning progress and negatively impact student outcomes. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach, Discrimination Learning Enhances\nLearning Path Recommendation (DLELP), which enhances learning path\nrecommendations by incorporating both prerequisite and similarity relationships\nbetween knowledge concepts. Specifically, we introduce a knowledge concept\nstructure graph generation module that adaptively constructs knowledge concept\nstructure graphs for different educational datasets, significantly improving\nthe generalizability of learning path recommendation methods. We then propose a\nDiscrimination Learning-driven Reinforcement Learning (DLRL) framework, which\nmitigates the issue of blocked learning paths, further enhancing the efficacy\nof learning path recommendations. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on\nthree benchmark datasets, demonstrating that our method not only achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance but also provides interpretable reasoning for the\nrecommended learning paths.",

This article provides a comprehensive\nreview of how LLM-based conversational agents are being used in higher\neducation, with extensions to secondary and lifelong learning contexts. We\nsynthesize existing literature on LLMs in education and theories of\nconversational and dialogic pedagogy - including Vygotsky's sociocultural\nlearning (scaffolding and the Zone of Proximal Development), the Socratic\nmethod, and Laurillard's conversational framework - and examine how prompting\nstrategies and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can align LLM behaviors\nwith these pedagogical theories, and how it can support personalized, adaptive\nlearning. We map educational theories to LLM capabilities, highlighting where\nLLM-driven dialogue supports established learning principles and where it\nchallenges or falls short of traditional pedagogical assumptions. Notable gaps\nin applying prior theories to LLMs are identified, such as the models tendency\nto provide direct answers instead of fostering co-construction of knowledge,\nand the need to account for the constant availability and broad but non-human\nexpertise of LLM tutors. In response, we propose practical strategies to better\nalign LLM interactions with sound pedagogy - for example, designing prompts\nthat encourage Socratic questioning, scaffolded guidance, and student\nreflection, as well as integrating retrieval mechanisms to ensure accuracy and\ncontextual relevance.

Unlike\ntraditional RAG systems that rely solely on semantic similarity (Conversation\nRAG) or standard knowledge graphs (GraphRAG), CID-GraphRAG constructs dynamic\nintent transition graphs from goal achieved historical dialogues and implements\na dual-retrieval mechanism that adaptively balances intent-based graph\ntraversal with semantic search. This approach enables the system to\nsimultaneously leverage both conversional intent flow patterns and contextual\nsemantics, significantly improving retrieval quality and response quality. In\nextensive experiments on real-world customer service dialogues, we employ both\nautomatic metrics and LLM-as-judge assessments, demonstrating that CID-GraphRAG\nsignificantly outperforms both semantic-based Conversation RAG and intent-based\nGraphRAG baselines across all evaluation criteria.

    "summary": "Since the introduction of ChatGPT, large language models (LLMs) have\ndemonstrated significant utility in various tasks, such as answering questions\nthrough retrieval-augmented generation. Context can be retrieved using a\nvectorized database, serving as a foundation for LLMs to generate responses.\nHowever, hallucinations in responses can undermine the reliability of LLMs in\npractical applications, and they are not easily detectable in the absence of\nground truth, particularly in question-and-answer scenarios. This paper\nproposes a framework that integrates multiple small language models to verify\nresponses generated by LLMs using the retrieved context from a vectorized\ndatabase. By breaking down the responses into individual sentences and\nutilizing the probability of generating \"Yes\" tokens from the outputs of\nmultiple models for a given set of questions, responses, and relevant context,\nhallucinations can be detected. The proposed framework is validated through\nexperiments with real datasets comprising over 100 sets of questions, answers,\nand contexts, including responses with fully and partially correct sentences.\nThe results demonstrate a 10\\% improvement in F1 scores for detecting correct\nresponses compared to hallucinations, indicating that multiple small language\nmodels can be effectively employed for answer verification, providing a\nscalable and efficient solution for both academic and practical applications.",

To address these limitations, we propose Temporal\nCausal Probabilistic Description Logic (T-CPDL), an integrated framework that\nextends traditional Description Logic with temporal interval operators,\nexplicit causal relationships, and probabilistic annotations. We present two\ndistinct variants of T-CPDL: one capturing qualitative temporal relationships\nthrough Allen's interval algebra, and another variant enriched with explicit\ntimestamped causal assertions. Both variants share a unified logical structure,\nenabling complex reasoning tasks ranging from simple temporal ordering to\nnuanced probabilistic causation. Empirical evaluations on temporal reasoning\nand causal inference benchmarks confirm that T-CPDL substantially improves\ninference accuracy, interpretability, and confidence calibration of language\nmodel outputs.

    "title": "Measuring and Augmenting Large Language Models for Solving\n  Capture-the-Flag Challenges",
    "summary": "Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions are crucial for cybersecurity education\nand training. As large language models (LLMs) evolve, there is increasing\ninterest in their ability to automate CTF challenge solving. For example, DARPA\nhas organized the AIxCC competition since 2023 to advance AI-powered automated\noffense and defense. However, this demands a combination of multiple abilities,\nfrom knowledge to reasoning and further to actions. In this paper, we highlight\nthe importance of technical knowledge in solving CTF problems and deliberately\nconstruct a focused benchmark, CTFKnow, with 3,992 questions to measure LLMs'\nperformance in this core aspect. Our study offers a focused and innovative\nmeasurement of LLMs' capability in understanding CTF knowledge and applying it\nto solve CTF challenges. Our key findings reveal that while LLMs possess\nsubstantial technical knowledge, they falter in accurately applying this\nknowledge to specific scenarios and adapting their strategies based on feedback\nfrom the CTF environment.\n  Based on insights derived from this measurement study, we propose CTFAgent, a\nnovel LLM-driven framework for advancing CTF problem-solving. CTFAgent\nintroduces two new modules: two-stage Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and\ninteractive Environmental Augmentation, which enhance LLMs' technical knowledge\nand vulnerability exploitation on CTF, respectively. Our experimental results\nshow that, on two popular CTF datasets, CTFAgent both achieves over 80%\nperformance improvement. Moreover, in the recent picoCTF2024 hosted by CMU,\nCTFAgent ranked in the top 23.6% of nearly 7,000 participating teams. This\nreflects the benefit of our measurement study and the potential of our\nframework in advancing LLMs' capabilities in CTF problem-solving.",

The effectiveness of\nICL heavily relies on the quality of these examples, and previous works which\nfocused on enhancing example retrieval capabilities have achieved impressive\nperformances. However, two challenges remain in retrieving high-quality\nexamples: (1) Difficulty in distinguishing cross-task data distributions, (2)\nDifficulty in making the fine-grained connection between retriever output and\nfeedback from LLMs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called TDR. TDR\ndecouples the ICL examples from different tasks, which enables the retrieval\nmodule to retrieve examples specific to the target task within a multi-task\ndataset. Furthermore, TDR models fine-grained feedback from LLMs to supervise\nand guide the training of the retrieval module, which helps to retrieve\nhigh-quality examples. We conducted extensive experiments on a suite of 30 NLP\ntasks, the results demonstrate that TDR consistently improved results across\nall datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

    "title": "StyleAdaptedLM: Enhancing Instruction Following Models with Efficient\n  Stylistic Transfer",
    "summary": "Adapting LLMs to specific stylistic characteristics, like brand voice or\nauthorial tones, is crucial for enterprise communication but challenging to\nachieve from corpora which lacks instruction-response formatting without\ncompromising instruction adherence. We introduce StyleAdaptedLM, a framework\nthat efficiently transfers stylistic traits to instruction-following models\nusing Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). LoRA adapters are first trained on a base\nmodel with diverse unstructured stylistic corpora, then merged with a separate\ninstruction-following model. This enables robust stylistic customization\nwithout paired data or sacrificing task performance. Experiments across\nmultiple datasets and models demonstrate improved stylistic consistency while\npreserving instruction adherence, with human evaluations confirming\nbrand-specific convention uptake. StyleAdaptedLM offers an efficient path for\nstylistic personalization in LLMs.",
